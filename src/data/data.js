Ἆρ᾽ οὖν καὶ ἡμεῖς παίζοντες ἐν τῷ παρόντι θεωροῦμεν; Ἢ καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ πάντες ὅσοι παίζουσι τοῦτο ποιοῦσιν ἢ τούτου γε παίζουσιν ἐφιέμενοι. Καὶ κινδυνεύει, εἴτε τις παῖς εἴτε ἀνὴρ παίζει ἢ σπουδάζει, θεωρίας ἕνεκεν ὁ μὲν παίζειν, ὁ δὲ σπουδάζειν, καὶ πρᾶξις πᾶσα εἰς θεωρίαν τὴν σπουδὴν ἔχειν, ἡ μὲν ἀναγκαία καὶ ἐπιπλέον, τὴν θεωρίαν ἕλκουσα πρὸς τὸ ἔξω, ἡ δὲ ἑκούσιος λεγομένη ἐπ᾽ ἔλαττον μέν, ὅμως δὲ καὶ αὕτη ἐφέσει θεωρίας γινομένη. Ἀλλὰ ταῦτα μὲν ὕστερον· νῦν δὲ λέγωμεν περί τε γῆς αὐτῆς καὶ δένδρων καὶ ὅλως φυτῶν τίς αὐτῶν ἡ θεωρία, καὶ πῶς τὰ παρ᾽ αὐτῆς ποιούμενα καὶ γεννώμενα ἐπὶ τὴν τῆς θεωρίας ἀνάξομεν ἐνέργειαν, καὶ πῶς ἡ φύσις, ἣν ἀφάνταστόν φασι καὶ ἄλογον εἶναι, θεωρίαν τε ἐν αὐτῇ ἔχει καὶ ἃ ποιεῖ διὰ θεωρίαν ποιεῖ, ἣν οὐκ ἔχει [καὶ πῶς].

2 Ὅτι μὲν οὖν οὔτε χεῖρες ἐνταῦθα οὔτε πόδες οὔτε τι ὄργανον ἐπακτὸν ἢ σύμφυτον, ὕλης δὲ δεῖ, [ἐφ᾽ ἧς ποιήσει,] καθ᾽ ἣν ἐνειδοποιεῖ, παντί που δῆλον. Δεῖ δὲ καὶ τὸ μοχλεύειν ἀφελεῖν ἐκ τῆς φυσικῆς ποιήσεως. Ποῖος γὰρ ὠθισμὸς ἢ τίς μοχλεία χρώματα ποικίλα καὶ παντοδαπὰ καὶ σχήματα ποιεῖ; Ἐπεὶ οὐδὲ οἱ κηροπλάσται [ἢ κοροπλάθαι], εἰς οὓς δὴ καὶ βλέποντες ὠιήθησαν τὴν τῆς φύσεως δημιουργίαν τοιαύτην εἶναι, χρώματα δύνανται ποιεῖν μὴ χρώματα ἀλλαχόθεν ἐπάγοντες οἷς ποιοῦσιν. Ἀλλὰ γὰρ ἐχρῆν συννοοῦντας, ὡς καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τὰς τέχνας τὰς τοιαύτας μετιόντων [ὅτι] δεῖ τι ἐν αὐτοῖς μένειν, καθ᾽ ὃ μένον διὰ χειρῶν ποιήσουσιν ἃ αὐτῶν ἔργα, ἐπὶ τὸ τοιοῦτον ἀνελθεῖν τῆς φύσεως καὶ αὐτοὺς καὶ συνεῖναι, ὡς μένειν δεῖ καὶ ἐνταῦθα τὴν δύναμιν τὴν οὐ διὰ χειρῶν ποιοῦσαν καὶ πᾶσαν μένειν. Οὐ γὰρ δὴ δεῖται τῶν μὲν ὡς μενόντων, τῶν δὲ ὡς κινουμένων – ἡ γὰρ ὕλη τὸ κινούμενον, αὐτῆς δὲ οὐδὲν κινούμενον – ἢ ἐκεῖνο οὐκ ἔσται τὸ κινοῦν πρώτως, οὐδὲ ἡ φύσις τοῦτο, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀκίνητον τὸ ἐν τῷ ὅλῳ. Ὁ μὲν δὴ λόγος, φαίη ἄν τις, ἀκίνητος, αὕτη δὲ ἄλλη παρὰ τὸν λόγον καὶ κινουμένη. Ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μὲν πᾶσαν φήσουσι, καὶ ὁ λόγος· εἰ δέ τι αὐτῆς ἀκίνητον, τοῦτο καὶ ὁ λόγος. Καὶ γὰρ εἶδος αὐτὴν δεῖ εἶναι καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ὕλης καὶ εἴδους· τί γὰρ δεῖ αὐτῇ ὕλης θερμῆς ἢ ψυχρᾶς; Ἡ γὰρ ὑποκειμένη καὶ δημιουργουμένη ὕλη ἥκει τοῦτο φέρουσα, ἢ γίνεται τοιαύτη ἡ μὴ ποιότητα ἔχουσα λογωθεῖσα. Οὐ γὰρ πῦρ δεῖ προσελθεῖν, ἵνα πῦρ ἡ ὕλη γένηται, ἀλλὰ λόγον· ὃ καὶ σημεῖον οὐ μικρὸν τοῦ ἐν τοῖς ζώιοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς φυτοῖς τοὺς λόγους εἶναι τοὺς ποιοῦντας καὶ τὴν φύσιν εἶναι λόγον, ὃς ποιεῖ λόγον ἄλλον γέννημα αὐτοῦ δόντα μέν τι τῷ ὑποκειμένῳ, μένοντα δ᾽ αὐτόν. Ὁ μὲν οὖν λόγος ὁ κατὰ τὴν μορφὴν τὴν ὁρωμένην ἔσχατος ἤδη καὶ νεκρὸς καὶ οὐκέτι ποιεῖν δύναται ἄλλον, ὁ δὲ ζωὴν ἔχων ὁ τοῦ ποιήσαντος τὴν μορφὴν ἀδελφὸς ὢν καὶ αὐτὸς τὴν αὐτὴν δύναμιν ἔχων ποιεῖ ἐν τῷ γενομένῳ.

3 Πῶς οὖν ποιῶν καὶ οὕτω ποιῶν θεωρίας τινὸς ἂν ἐφάπτοιτο; Ἤ, εἰ μένων ποιεῖ καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ μένων καί ἐστι λόγος, εἴη ἂν αὐτὸς θεωρία. Ἡ μὲν γὰρ πρᾶξις γένοιτ᾽ ἂν κατὰ λόγον ἑτέρα οὖσα δηλονότι τοῦ λόγου·

ὁ μέντοι λόγος καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ συνὼν τῇ πράξει καὶ ἐπιστατῶν οὐκ ἂν εἴη πρᾶξις. Εἰ οὖν μὴ πρᾶξις ἀλλὰ λόγος, θεωρία· καὶ ἐπὶ παντὸς λόγου ὁ μὲν ἔσχατος ἐκ θεωρίας καὶ θεωρία οὕτως ὡς τεθεωρημένος, ὁ δὲ πρὸ τούτου πᾶς ὁ μὲν ἄλλος ἄλλως, ὁ μὴ ὡς φύσις ἀλλὰ ψυχή, ὁ δ᾽ ἐν τῇ φύσει καὶ ἡ φύσις. Ἆρά γε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκ θεωρίας; Πάντως μὲν ἐκ θεωρίας. Ἀλλ᾽ εἰ καὶ αὐτὸς τεθεωρηκὼς αὑτόν; ἢ πῶς; ἔστι μὲν γὰρ ἀποτέλεσμα θεωρίας καὶ θεωρήσαντός τινος. Πῶς δὲ αὕτη ἔχει θεωρίαν; Τὴν μὲν δὴ ἐκ λόγου οὐκ ἔχει· λέγω δ᾽ ἐκ λόγου τὸ σκοπεῖσθαι περὶ τῶν ἐν αὐτῇ. Διὰ τί οὖν ζωή τις οὖσα καὶ λόγος καὶ δύναμις ποιοῦσα; Ἆρ᾽ ὅτι τὸ σκοπεῖσθαί ἐστι τὸ μήπω ἔχειν; Ἡ δὲ ἔχει, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὅτι ἔχει καὶ ποιεῖ. Τὸ οὖν εἶναι αὐτῇ ὅ ἐστι τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ ποιεῖν αὐτῇ καὶ ὅσον ἐστὶ τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ ποιοῦν. Ἔστι δὲ θεωρία καὶ θεώρημα, λόγος γάρ. Τῷ οὖν εἶναι θεωρία καὶ θεώρημα καὶ λόγος τούτῳ καὶ ποιεῖ ἧι ταῦτά ἐστιν. Ἡ ποίησις ἄρα θεωρία ἡμῖν ἀναπέφανται· ἔστι γὰρ ἀποτέλεσμα θεωρίας μενούσης θεωρίας οὐκ ἄλλο τι πραξάσης, ἀλλὰ τῷ εἶναι θεωρία ποιησάσης.

4 Καὶ εἴ τις δὲ αὐτὴν ἔροιτο τίνος ἕνεκα ποιεῖ, εἰ τοῦ ἐρωτῶντος ἐθέλοι ἐπαίειν καὶ λέγειν, εἴποι ἄν· Ἐχρῆν μὲν μὴ ἐρωτᾶν, ἀλλὰ συνιέναι καὶ αὐτὸν σιωπῇ, ὥσπερ ἐγὼ σιωπῶ καὶ οὐκ εἴθισμαι λέγειν. Τί οὖν συνιέναι; Ὅτι τὸ γενόμενόν ἐστι θέαμα ἐμὸν σιωπώσης, καὶ φύσει γενόμενον θεώρημα, καί μοι γενομένῃ ἐκ θεωρίας τῆς ὡδὶ τὴν φύσιν ἔχειν φιλοθεάμονα ὑπάρχειν. Καὶ τὸ θεωροῦν μου θεώρημα ποιεῖ, ὥσπερ οἱ γεωμέτραι θεωροῦντες γράφουσιν· ἀλλ᾽ ἐμοῦ μὴ γραφούσης, θεωρούσης δέ, ὑφίστανται αἱ τῶν σωμάτων γραμμαὶ ὥσπερ ἐκπίπτουσαι. Καί μοι τὸ τῆς μητρὸς καὶ τῶν γειναμένων ὑπάρχει πάθος· καὶ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοί εἰσιν ἐκ θεωρίας καὶ ἡ γένεσις ἡ ἐμὴ ἐκείνων οὐδὲν πραξάντων, ἀλλ᾽ ὄντων μειζόνων λόγων καὶ θεωρούντων αὑτοὺς ἐγὼ γεγέννημαι.

Τί οὖν ταῦτα βούλεται; Ὡς ἡ μὲν λεγομένη φύσις ψυχὴ οὖσα, γέννημα ψυχῆς προτέρας δυνατώτερον ζώσης, ἡσυχῇ ἐν ἑαυτῇ θεωρίαν ἔχουσα οὐ πρὸς τὸ ἄνω οὐδ᾽ αὖ ἔτι πρὸς τὸ κάτω, στᾶσα δὲ ἐν ὧι ἔστιν, ἐν τῇ αὑτῆς στάσει καὶ οἷον συναισθήσει, τῇ συνέσει ταύτῃ καὶ συναισθήσει τὸ μετ᾽ αὐτὴν εἶδεν ὡς οἷόν τε αὐτῇ καὶ οὐκέτι ἐζήτησεν ἄλλα θεώρημα ἀποτελέσασα ἀγλαὸν καὶ χάριεν. Καὶ εἴτε τις βούλεται σύνεσίν τινα ἢ αἴσθησιν αὐτῇ διδόναι, οὐχ οἵαν λέγομεν ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων τὴν αἴσθησιν ἢ τὴν σύνεσιν, ἀλλ᾽ οἷον εἴ τις τὴν καθύπνου τῇ ἐγρηγορότος προσεικάσειε. Θεωροῦσα γὰρ θεώρημα αὐτῆς ἀναπαύεται γενόμενον αὐτῇ ἐκ τοῦ ἐν αὑτῇ καὶ σὺν αὑτῇ μένειν καὶ θεώρημα εἶναι· καὶ θεωρία ἄψοφος, ἀμυδροτέρα δέ. Ἑτέρα γὰρ αὐτῆς εἰς θέαν ἐναργεστέρα, ἡ δὲ εἴδωλον θεωρίας ἄλλης. Ταύτῃ δὴ καὶ τὸ γεννηθὲν ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἀσθενὲς παντάπασιν, ὅτι ἀσθενοῦσα θεωρία ἀσθενὲς θεώρημα ποιεῖ· ἐπεὶ καὶ ἄνθρωποι, ὅταν ἀσθενήσωσιν εἰς τὸ θεωρεῖν, σκιὰν θεωρίας καὶ λόγου τὴν πρᾶξιν ποιοῦνται. Ὅτι γὰρ μὴ ἱκανὸν αὐτοῖς τὸ τῆς θεωρίας ὑπ᾽ ἀσθενείας ψυχῆς, λαβεῖν οὐ δυνάμενοι τὸ θέαμα ἱκανῶς καὶ διὰ τοῦτο οὐ πληρούμενοι, ἐφιέμενοι δὲ αὐτὸ ἰδεῖν, εἰς πρᾶξιν φέρονται, ἵνα ἴδωσιν, ὃ μὴ νῷ ἐδύναντο. Ὅταν γοῦν ποιῶσι, καὶ αὐτοὶ ὁρᾶν βούλονται αὐτὸ καὶ θεωρεῖν καὶ αἰσθάνεσθαι καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους, ὅταν ἡ πρόθεσις αὐτοῖς ὡς οἷόν τε πρᾶξις ἦ. Πανταχοῦ δὴ ἀνευρήσομεν τὴν ποίησιν καὶ τὴν πρᾶξιν ἢ ἀσθένειαν θεωρίας ἢ παρακολούθημα· ἀσθένειαν μέν, εἰ μηδέν τις ἔχοι μετὰ τὸ πραχθέν, παρακολούθημα δέ, εἰ ἔχοι ἄλλο πρὸ τούτου κρεῖττον τοῦ ποιηθέντος θεωρεῖν. Τίς γὰρ θεωρεῖν τὸ ἀληθινὸν δυνάμενος προηγουμένως ἔρχεται ἐπὶ τὸ εἴδωλον τοῦ ἀληθινοῦ; Μαρτυροῦσι δὲ καὶ οἱ νωθέστεροι τῶν παίδων, οἳ πρὸς τὰς μαθήσεις καὶ θεωρίας ἀδυνάτως ἔχοντες ἐπὶ τὰς τέχνας καὶ τὰς ἐργασίας καταφέρονται.

5  Ἀλλὰ περὶ μὲν φύσεως εἰπόντες ὃν τρόπον θεωρία ἡ γένεσις, ἐπὶ τὴν ψυχὴν τὴν πρὸ ταύτης ἐλθόντες λέγωμεν, ὡς ἡ ταύτης θεωρία καὶ τὸ φιλομαθὲς καὶ τὸ ζητητικὸν καὶ ἡ ἐξ ὧν ἐγνώκει ὠδὶς καὶ τὸ πλῆρες πεποίηκεν αὐτὴν θεώρημα πᾶν γενομένην ἄλλο θεώρημα ποιῆσαι· οἷον ἡ τέχνη ποιεῖ· ὅταν ἑκάστη πλήρης ἦ, ἄλλην οἵαν μικρὰν τέχνην ποιεῖ ἐν παιγνίῳ ἴνδαλμα ἔχοντι ἁπάντων· ἄλλως μέντοι ταῦτα ὥσπερ ἀμυδρὰ καὶ οὐ δυνάμενα βοηθεῖν ἑαυτοῖς θεάματα καὶ θεωρήματα. Τὸ πρῶτον. [Τὸ λογιστικὸν] οὖν αὐτῆς ἄνω πρὸς τὸ ἄνω ἀεὶ πληρούμενον καὶ ἐλλαμπόμενον μένει ἐκεῖ, τὸ δὲ τῇ τοῦ μεταλαβόντος πρώτῃ μεταλήψει μεταλαμβάνον [πρόεισι]· πρόεισι γὰρ ἀεὶ ζωὴ ἐκ ζωῆς· ἐνέργεια γὰρ πανταχοῦ φθάνει καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅτου ἀποστατεῖ. Προιοῦσα μέντοι ἐᾶι τὸ πρότερον [τὸ ἑαυτῆς πρόσθεν] μέρος οὗ καταλέλοιπε μένειν· ἀπολιποῦσα γὰρ τὸ [ἑαυτῆς] πρόσθεν οὐκέτι ἔσται πανταχοῦ, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν ὧι τελευτᾶι μόνον. Οὐκ ἴσον δὲ τὸ προιὸν τῷ μείναντι. Εἰ οὖν πανταχοῦ δεῖ γίνεσθαι καὶ μὴ εἶναι ὅπου μὴ τὴν ἐνέργειαν τὴν αὐτὴν ἀεί τε τὸ πρότερον ἕτερον τοῦ ὑστέρου, ἥκει δὲ ἡ ἐνέργεια ἐκ θεωρίας ἢ πράξεως, πρᾶξις δὲ οὔπω ἦν – οὐ γὰρ οἷόν τε πρὸ θεωρίας – ἀνάγκη ἀσθενεστέραν μὲν ἑτέραν ἑτέρας εἶναι, πᾶσαν δὲ θεωρίαν· ὥστε τὴν κατὰ τὴν θεωρίαν πρᾶξιν δοκοῦσαν εἶναι τὴν ἀσθενεστάτην θεωρίαν εἶναι· ὁμογενὲς γὰρ ἀεὶ δεῖ τὸ γεννώμενον εἶναι, ἀσθενέστερον μὴν τῷ ἐξίτηλον καταβαῖνον γίγνεσθαι. Ἀψοφητὶ μὲν δὴ πάντα, ὅτι μηδὲν ἐμφανοῦς καὶ τῆς ἔξωθεν θεωρίας ἢ πράξεως δεῖται, καὶ ψυχὴ δὲ ἡ θεωροῦσα καὶ τὸ οὕτω θεωρῆσαν ἅτε ἐξωτέρω καὶ οὐχ ὡσαύτως τῷ πρὸ αὐτῆς τὸ μετ᾽ αὐτὴν ποιεῖ· καὶ θεωρία τὴν θεωρίαν ποιεῖ. Καὶ γὰρ οὐκ ἔχει πέρας ἡ θεωρία οὐδὲ τὸ θεώρημα. Διὰ τοῦτο δέ· [ἢ καὶ διὰ τοῦτο] πανταχοῦ· ποῦ γὰρ οὐχί; Ἐπεὶ καὶ ἐν πάσῃ ψυχῇ τὸ αὐτό. Οὐ γὰρ περιγέγραπται μεγέθει. Οὐ μὴν ὡσαύτως ἐν πᾶσιν, ὥστε οὐδὲ ἐν παντὶ μέρει ψυχῆς ὁμοίως. Διὸ ὁ ἡνίοχος τοῖς ἵπποις δίδωσιν ὧν εἶδεν, οἱ δὲ λαβόντες δηλονότι ὀρέγοιντο ἂν ὧν εἶδον· ἔλαβον γὰρ οὐ πᾶν. Ὀρεγόμενοι δὲ εἰ πράττοιεν, οὗ ὀρέγονται ἕνεκα πράττουσιν. Ἦν δὲ θεώρημα καὶ θεωρία ἐκεῖνο.

6 Ἡ ἄρα πρᾶξις ἕνεκα θεωρίας καὶ θεωρήματος· ὥστε καὶ τοῖς πράττουσιν ἡ θεωρία τέλος, καὶ οἷον ἐξ εὐθείας ὃ μὴ ἠδυνήθησαν λαβεῖν τοῦτο περιπλανώμενοι ἑλεῖν ζητοῦσι. Καὶ γὰρ αὖ ὅταν τύχωσιν οὗ βούλονται, ὃ γενέσθαι ἠθέλησαν, οὐχ ἵνα μὴ γνῶσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἵνα γνῶσι καὶ παρὸν ἴδωσιν ἐν ψυχῇ, δῆλον ὅτι κείμενον θεατόν. Ἐπεὶ καὶ ἀγαθοῦ χάριν πράττουσι· τοῦτο δὲ οὐχ ἵνα ἔξω αὐτῶν, οὐδ᾽ ἵνα μὴ ἔχωσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἵνα ἔχωσι τὸ ἐκ τῆς πράξεως ἀγαθόν. Τοῦτο δὲ ποῦ; Ἐν ψυχῇ. Ἀνέκαμψεν οὖν πάλιν ἡ πρᾶξις εἰς θεωρίαν· ὃ γὰρ ἐν ψυχῇ λαμβάνει λόγῳ οὔσῃ, τί ἂν ἄλλο ἢ λόγος σιωπῶν εἴη; Καὶ μᾶλλον, ὅσῳ μᾶλλον. Τότε γὰρ καὶ ἡσυχίαν ἄγει καὶ οὐδὲν ζητεῖ ὡς πληρωθεῖσα, καὶ ἡ θεωρία ἡ ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ τῷ πιστεύειν ἔχειν εἴσω κεῖται. Καὶ ὅσῳ ἐναργεστέρα ἡ πίστις, ἡσυχαιτέρα καὶ ἡ θεωρία, ἧι μᾶλλον εἰς ἓν ἄγει, καὶ τὸ γινῶσκον ὅσῳ γινώσκει – ἤδη γὰρ σπουδαστέον – εἰς ἓν τῷ γνωσθέντι ἔρχεται. Εἰ γὰρ δύο, τὸ μὲν ἄλλο, τὸ δὲ ἄλλο ἔσται· ὥστε οἷον παράκειται, καὶ τὸ διπλοῦν τοῦτο οὔπω ὠικείωσεν, οἷον ὅταν ἐνόντες λόγοι ἐν ψυχῇ μηδὲν ποιῶσι. Διὸ δεῖ μὴ ἔξωθεν τὸν λόγον εἶναι, ἀλλ᾽ ἑνωθῆναι τῇ ψυχῇ τοῦ μανθάνοντος, ἕως ἂν οἰκεῖον εὕρῃ. Ἡ μὲν οὖν ψυχή, ὅταν οἰκειωθῇ καὶ διατεθῇ, ὅμως προφέρει καὶ προχειρίζεται – οὐ γὰρ πρώτως εἶχε – καὶ καταμανθάνει, καὶ τῇ προχειρίσει οἷον ἑτέρα αὐτοῦ γίνεται, καὶ διανοουμένη βλέπει ὡς ἄλλο ὂν ἄλλο· καίτοι καὶ αὕτη λόγος ἦν καὶ οἷον νοῦς, ἀλλ᾽ ὁρῶν ἄλλο. Ἔστι γὰρ οὐ πλήρης, ἀλλὰ ἐλλείπει τῷ πρὸ αὐτῆς· ὁρᾶι μέντοι καὶ αὐτὴ ἡσύχως ἃ προφέρει. Ἃ μὲν γὰρ εὖ προήνεγκεν, οὐκέτι προφέρει, ἃ δὲ προφέρει, τῷ ἐλλιπεῖ προφέρει εἰς ἐπίσκεψιν καταμανθάνουσα ὃ ἔχει. Ἐν δὲ τοῖς πρακτικοῖς ἐφαρμόττει ἃ ἔχει τοῖς ἔξω. Καὶ τῷ μὲν μᾶλλον ἔχειν ἢ ἡ φύσις ἡσυχαιτέρα, καὶ τῷ πλέον θεωρητικὴ μᾶλλον, τῷ δὲ μὴ τελέως ἐφιεμένη μᾶλλον ἔχειν τὴν τοῦ θεωρηθέντος καταμάθησιν καὶ θεωρίαν τὴν ἐξ ἐπισκέψεως. Καὶ ἀπολείπουσα δὲ καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις γινομένη, εἶτ᾽ ἐπανιοῦσα πάλιν, θεωρεῖ τῷ ἀπολειφθέντι αὐτῆς μέρει· ἡ δὲ στᾶσα ἐν αὑτῇ ἧττον τοῦτο ποιεῖ. Διὸ ὁ σπουδαῖος λελόγισται ἤδη καὶ τὸ παρ᾽ αὑτοῦ πρὸς ἄλλον ἀποφαίνει· πρὸς δὲ αὑτὸν ὄψις. Ἤδη γὰρ οὗτος πρὸς τὸ ἓν καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἥσυχον οὐ μόνον τῶν ἔξω, ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς αὑτόν, καὶ πάντα εἴσω.

7 Ὅτι μὲν οὖν πάντα τά τε ὡς ἀληθῶς ὄντα ἐκ θεωρίας καὶ θεωρία, καὶ τὰ ἐξ ἐκείνων γενόμενα θεωρούντων ἐκείνων καὶ αὐτὰ θεωρήματα, τὰ μὲν αἰσθήσει τὰ δὲ γνώσει ἢ δόξῃ, καὶ αἱ πράξεις τὸ τέλος ἔχουσιν εἰς γνῶσιν καὶ ἡ ἔφεσις γνώσεως καὶ αἱ γεννήσεις ἀπὸ θεωρίας εἰς ἀποτελεύτησιν εἴδους καὶ θεωρήματος ἄλλου, καὶ ὅλως μιμήματα ὄντα ἕκαστα τῶν ποιούντων θεωρήματα ποιεῖ καὶ εἴδη, καὶ αἱ γινόμεναι ὑποστάσεις μιμήσεις ὄντων οὖσαι ποιοῦντα δείκνυσι τέλος ποιούμενα οὐ τὰς ποιήσεις οὐδὲ τὰς πράξεις, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀποτέλεσμα ἵνα θεωρηθῇ, καὶ τοῦτο καὶ αἱ διανοήσεις ἰδεῖν θέλουσι καὶ ἔτι πρότερον αἱ αἰσθήσεις, αἷς τέλος ἡ γνῶσις, καὶ ἔτι πρὸ τούτων ἡ φύσις τὸ θεώρημα τὸ ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ τὸν λόγον ποιεῖ ἄλλον λόγον ἀποτελοῦσα – τὰ μὲν ἦν αὐτόθεν λαβεῖν, τὰ δ᾽ ὑπέμνησεν ὁ λόγος – δῆλόν που. Ἐπεὶ κἀκεῖνο δῆλον, ὡς ἀναγκαῖον ἦν τῶν πρώτων ἐν θεωρίαι ὄντων καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πάντα ἐφίεσθαι τούτου, εἴπερ τέλος ἅπασιν ἡ ἀρχή.

Ἐπεὶ καί, ὅταν τὰ ζῷα γεννᾶι, οἱ λόγοι ἔνδον ὄντες κινοῦσι, καὶ ἔστιν ἐνέργεια θεωρίας τοῦτο καὶ ὠδὶς τοῦ πολλὰ ποιεῖν εἴδη καὶ πολλὰ θεωρήματα καὶ λόγων πληρῶσαι πάντα καὶ οἷον ἀεὶ θεωρεῖν· τὸ γὰρ ποιεῖν εἶναί τι εἶδός ἐστι ποιεῖν, τοῦτο δέ ἐστι πάντα πληρῶσαι θεωρίας. Καὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι δέ, αἵ τε ἐν τοῖς γινομένοις αἵ τε ἐν τοῖς πραττομένοις, θεωρούντων εἰσὶν ἐκ τοῦ θεωρητοῦ παραφορᾶι· καὶ ὅ γε κακὸς τεχνίτης ἔοικεν αἰσχρὰ εἴδη ποιοῦντι. Καὶ οἱ ἐρῶντες δὲ ἰδόντων καὶ πρὸς εἶδος σπευδόντων.

8 Ταῦτα μὲν οὕτω. Τῆς δὲ θεωρίας ἀναβαινούσης ἐκ τῆς φύσεως ἐπὶ ψυχὴν καὶ ἀπὸ ταύτης εἰς νοῦν καὶ ἀεὶ οἰκειοτέρων τῶν θεωριῶν γιγνομένων καὶ ἑνουμένων τοῖς θεωροῦσι καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς σπουδαίας ψυχῆς πρὸς τὸ αὐτὸ τῷ ὑποκειμένῳ ἰόντων τῶν ἐγνωσμένων ἅτε εἰς νοῦν σπευδόντων, ἐπὶ τούτου δηλονότι ἤδη ἓν ἄμφω οὐκ οἰκειώσει, ὥσπερ ἐπὶ τῆς ψυχῆς τῆς ἀρίστης, ἀλλ᾽ οὐσίαι καὶ τῷ ταὐτὸν τὸ εἶναι καὶ τὸ νοεῖν εἶναι. Οὐ γὰρ ἔτι ἄλλο, τὸ δ᾽ ἄλλο· πάλιν γὰρ αὖ ἄλλο ἔσται, ὃ οὐκέτι ἄλλο καὶ ἄλλο. Δεῖ οὖν τοῦτο εἶναι ἓν ὄντως ἄμφω· τοῦτο δέ ἐστι θεωρία ζῶσα, οὐ θεώρημα, οἷον τὸ ἐν ἄλλῳ. Τὸ γὰρ ἐν ἄλλῳ ζῶν δι᾽ ἐκεῖνο, οὐκ αὐτοζῶν. Εἰ οὖν ζήσεταί τι θεώρημα καὶ νόημα, δεῖ αὐτοζωὴν εἶναι οὐ φυτικὴν οὐδὲ αἰσθητικὴν οὐδὲ ψυχικὴν τὴν ἄλλην. Νοήσεις μὲν γάρ πως καὶ ἄλλαι· ἀλλ᾽ ἡ μὲν φυτικὴ νόησις, ἡ δὲ αἰσθητική, ἡ δὲ ψυχική. Πῶς οὖν νοήσεις; Ὅτι λόγοι.

Καὶ πᾶσα ζωὴ νόησίς τις, ἀλλὰ ἄλλη ἄλλης ἀμυδροτέρα, ὥσπερ καὶ ζωή. Ἡ δὲ ἐναργεστέρα· αὕτη καὶ πρώτη ζωὴ καὶ πρῶτος νοῦς εἷς. Νόησις οὖν ἡ πρώτη ζωὴ καὶ ζωὴ δευτέρα νόησις δευτέρα καὶ ἡ ἐσχάτη ζωὴ ἐσχάτη νόησις. Πᾶσα οὖν ζωὴ τοῦ γένους τούτου καὶ νόησις. Ἀλλὰ ζωῆς μὲν ἴσως διαφορὰς τάχ᾽ ἂν λέγοιεν ἄνθρωποι, νοήσεων δὲ οὐ λέγουσιν, ἀλλὰ τὰς μέν, τὰς δ᾽ ὅλως οὐ νοήσεις, ὅτι ὅλως τὴν ζωὴν ὅ τι ποτέ ἐστιν οὐ ζητοῦσιν. Ἀλλ᾽ ἐκεῖνό γε ἐπισημαντέον, ὅτι πάλιν αὖ ὁ λόγος πάρεργον ἐνδείκνυται θεωρίας τὰ πάντα ὄντα. Εἰ τοίνυν ἡ ζωὴ ἡ ἀληθεστάτη νοήσει ζωή ἐστιν, αὕτη δὲ ταὐτὸν τῇ ἀληθεστάτῃ νοήσει, ἡ ἀληθεστάτη νόησις ζῇ καὶ ἡ θεωρία καὶ τὸ θεώρημα τὸ τοιοῦτο ζῶν καὶ ζωὴ καὶ ἓν ὁμοῦ τὰ δύο. Ἓν οὖν ὂν τὰ δύο πῶς αὖ πολλὰ τοῦτο τὸ ἕν;

Ἢ ὅτι οὐχ ἓν θεωρεῖ. Ἐπεὶ καὶ ὅταν τὸ ἓν θεωρῇ, οὐχ ὡς ἕν· εἰ δὲ μή, οὐ γίνεται νοῦς. Ἀλλὰ ἀρξάμενος ὡς ἓν οὐχ ὡς ἤρξατο ἔμεινεν, ἀλλ᾽ ἔλαθεν ἑαυτὸν πολὺς γενόμενος, οἷον βεβαρημένος, καὶ ἐξείλιξεν αὑτὸν πάντα ἔχειν θέλων – ὡς βέλτιον ἦν αὐτῷ μὴ ἐθελῆσαι τοῦτο, δεύτερον γὰρ ἐγένετο – οἷον γὰρ κύκλος ἐξελίξας αὑτὸν γέγονε καὶ σχῆμα καὶ ἐπίπεδον καὶ περιφέρεια καὶ κέντρον καὶ γραμμαὶ καὶ τὰ μὲν ἄνω, τὰ δὲ κάτω· βελτίω μὲν ὅθεν, χείρω δὲ εἰς ὅ. Τὸ γὰρ εἰς ὃ οὐκ ἦν τοιοῦτον οἷον τὸ ἀφ᾽ οὗ καὶ εἰς ὅ, οὐδ᾽ αὖ τὸ ἀφ᾽ οὗ καὶ εἰς ὃ οἷον τὸ ἀφ᾽ οὗ μόνον. Καὶ ἄλλως δὲ ὁ νοῦς οὐχ ἑνός τινος νοῦς, ἀλλὰ καὶ πᾶς· πᾶς δὲ ὢν καὶ πάντων. Δεῖ οὖν αὐτὸν πάντα ὄντα καὶ πάντων καὶ τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ ἔχειν πᾶν καὶ πάντα· εἰ δὲ μή, ἕξει τι μέρος οὐ νοῦν, καὶ συγκείσεται ἐξ οὐ νῶν, καὶ σωρός τις συμφορητὸς ἔσται ἀναμένων τὸ γενέσθαι νοῦς ἐκ πάντων. Διὸ καὶ ἄπειρος οὕτως καί, εἴ τι ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἠλάττωται, οὔτε τὸ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι πάντα καὶ αὐτό, οὔτε ἐκεῖνος ὁ ἐξ οὗ, ὅτι μὴ σύνθεσις ἦν ἐκ μορίων.

9 Οὗτος μὲν οὖν τοιοῦτος· διὸ οὐ πρῶτος, ἀλλὰ δεῖ εἶναι τὸ ἐπέκεινα αὐτοῦ, οὗπερ χάριν καὶ οἱ πρόσθεν λόγοι, πρῶτον μέν, ὅτι πλῆθος ἑνὸς ὕστερον· καὶ ἀριθμὸς δὲ οὗτος, ἀριθμοῦ δὲ ἀρχὴ καὶ τοῦ τοιούτου τὸ ὄντως ἕν· καὶ οὗτος νοῦς καὶ νοητὸν ἅμα, ὥστε δύο ἅμα.

Εἰ δὲ δύο, δεῖ τὸ πρὸ τοῦ δύο λαβεῖν. Τί οὖν; Νοῦς μόνον; Ἀλλὰ παντὶ νῷ συνέζευκται τὸ νοητόν· εἰ οὖν δεῖ μὴ συνεζεῦχθαι τὸ νοητόν, οὐδὲ νοῦς ἔσται. Εἰ οὖν μὴ νοῦς, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκφεύξεται τὰ δύο, τὸ πρότερον τῶν δύο τούτων ἐπέκεινα νοῦ εἶναι. Τί οὖν κωλύει τὸ νοητὸν αὐτὸ εἶναι; Ἢ ὅτι καὶ τὸ νοητὸν συνέζευκτο τῷ νῷ. Εἰ οὖν μήτε νοῦς μήτε νοητὸν εἴη, τί ἂν εἴη; Ἐξ οὗ ὁ νοῦς καὶ τὸ σὺν αὐτῷ νοητὸν φήσομεν.

Τί οὖν τοῦτο καὶ ποῖόν τι αὐτὸ φαντασθησόμεθα; Καὶ γὰρ αὖ ἢ νοοῦν ἔσται ἢ ἀνόητόν τι. Νοοῦν μὲν οὖν νοῦς, ἀνόητον δὲ ἀγνοήσει καὶ ἑαυτό· ὥστε τί σεμνόν; Οὐδὲ γάρ, εἰ λέγοιμεν τὸ ἀγαθὸν εἶναι καὶ ἁπλούστατον εἶναι, δῆλόν τι καὶ σαφὲς ἐροῦμεν τὸ ἀληθὲς λέγοντες, ἕως ἂν μὴ ἔχωμεν ἐπὶ τί ἐρείδοντες τὴν διάνοιαν λέγομεν. Καὶ γὰρ αὖ τῆς γνώσεως διὰ νοῦ τῶν ἄλλων γινομένης καὶ τῷ νῷ νοῦν γινώσκειν δυναμένων ὑπερβεβηκὸς τοῦτο τὴν νοῦ φύσιν τίνι ἂν ἁλίσκοιτο ἐπιβολῇ ἀθρόαι; Πρὸς ὃν δεῖ σημῆναι, ὅπως οἷόν τε, τῷ ἐν ἡμῖν ὁμοίῳ φήσομεν. Ἔστι γάρ τι καὶ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν αὐτοῦ· ἢ οὐκ ἔστιν, ὅπου μὴ ἔστιν, οἷς ἐστι μετέχειν αὐτοῦ. Τὸ γὰρ πανταχοῦ παρὸν στήσας ὁπουοῦν τὸ δυνάμενον ἔχειν ἔχεις ἐκεῖθεν· ὥσπερ εἰ φωνῆς κατεχούσης ἐρημίαν ἢ καὶ μετὰ τῆς ἐρημίας καὶ ἀνθρώπους ἐν ὁτῳοῦν τοῦ ἐρήμου στήσας οὖς τὴν φωνὴν κομιεῖ πᾶσαν καὶ αὖ οὐ πᾶσαν. Τί οὖν ἐστιν ὃ κομιούμεθα νοῦν παραστησάμενοι; Ἢ δεῖ τὸν νοῦν οἷον εἰς τοὐπίσω ἀναχωρεῖν καὶ οἷον ἑαυτὸν ἀφέντα τοῖς εἰς ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ ἀμφίστομον ὄντα, κἀκεῖνα, εἰ ἐθέλοι ἐκεῖνο ὁρᾶν, μὴ πάντα νοῦν εἶναι. Ἔστι μὲν γὰρ αὐτὸς ζωὴ πρώτη, ἐνέργεια οὖσα ἐν διεξόδῳ τῶν πάντων· διεξόδῳ δὲ οὐ τῇ διεξιούσῃ, ἀλλὰ τῇ διεξελθούσῃ. Εἴπερ οὖν καὶ ζωή ἐστι καὶ διέξοδός ἐστι καὶ πάντα ἀκριβῶς καὶ οὐχ ὁλοσχερῶς ἔχει – ἀτελῶς γὰρ ἂν καὶ ἀδιαρθρώτως ἔχοι – ἔκ τινος ἄλλου αὐτὸν εἶναι, ὃ οὐκέτι ἐν διεξόδῳ, ἀλλὰ ἀρχὴ διεξόδου καὶ ἀρχὴ ζωῆς καὶ ἀρχὴ νοῦ καὶ τῶν πάντων. Οὐ γὰρ ἀρχὴ τὰ πάντα, ἀλλ᾽ ἐξ ἀρχῆς τὰ πάντα, αὕτη δὲ οὐκέτι τὰ πάντα οὐδέ τι τῶν πάντων, ἵνα γεννήσῃ τὰ πάντα, καὶ ἵνα μὴ πλῆθος ἦ, ἀλλὰ τοῦ πλήθους ἀρχή· τοῦ γὰρ γεννηθέντος πανταχοῦ τὸ γεννῶν ἁπλούστερον. Εἰ οὖν τοῦτο νοῦν ἐγέννησεν, ἁπλούστερον νοῦ δεῖ αὐτὸ εἶναι. Εἰ δέ τις οἴοιτο αὐτὸ τὸ ἓν καὶ τὰ πάντα εἶναι, ἤτοι καθ᾽ ἓν ἕκαστον τῶν πάντων ἐκεῖνο ἔσται ἢ ὁμοῦ πάντα. Εἰ μὲν οὖν ὁμοῦ πάντα συνηθροισμένα, ὕστερον ἔσται τῶν πάντων· εἰ δὲ πρότερον τῶν πάντων, ἄλλα μὲν τὰ πάντα, ἄλλο δὲ αὐτὸ ἔσται τῶν πάντων· εἰ δὲ ἅμα καὶ αὐτὸ καὶ τὰ πάντα, οὐκ ἀρχὴ ἔσται. Δεῖ δὲ αὐτὸ ἀρχὴν εἶναι καὶ εἶναι πρὸ πάντων, ἵνα ἦ μετ᾽ αὐτὸ καὶ τὰ πάντα. Τὸ δὲ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον τῶν πάντων πρῶτον μὲν τὸ αὐτὸ ἔσται ὁτιοῦν ὁτῳοῦν, ἔπειτα ὁμοῦ πάντα, καὶ οὐδὲν διακρινεῖ. Καὶ οὕτως οὐδὲν τῶν πάντων, ἀλλὰ πρὸ τῶν πάντων.

10 Τί δὴ ὄν; Δύναμις τῶν πάντων· ἧς μὴ οὔσης οὐδ᾽ ἂν τὰ πάντα, οὐδ᾽ ἂν νοῦς ζωὴ ἡ πρώτη καὶ πᾶσα. Τὸ δὲ ὑπὲρ τὴν ζωὴν αἴτιον ζωῆς· οὐ γὰρ ἡ τῆς ζωῆς ἐνέργεια τὰ πάντα οὖσα πρώτη, ἀλλ᾽ ὥσπερ προχυθεῖσα αὐτὴ οἷον ἐκ πηγῆς.

Νόησον γὰρ πηγὴν ἀρχὴν ἄλλην οὐκ ἔχουσαν, δοῦσαν δὲ ποταμοῖς πᾶσαν αὑτήν, οὐκ ἀναλωθεῖσαν τοῖς ποταμοῖς, ἀλλὰ μένουσαν αὐτὴν ἡσύχως, τοὺς δὲ ἐξ αὐτῆς προεληλυθότας πρὶν ἄλλον ἄλλῃ ῥεῖν ὁμοῦ συνόντας ἔτι, ἤδη δὲ οἷον ἑκάστους εἰδότας οἷ ἀφήσουσιν αὐτῶν τὰ ῥεύματα·

ἢ ζωὴν φυτοῦ μεγίστου διὰ παντὸς ἐλθοῦσαν ἀρχῆς μενούσης καὶ οὐ σκεδασθείσης περὶ πᾶν αὐτῆς οἷον ἐν ῥίζῃ ἱδρυμένης. Αὕτη τοίνυν παρέσχε μὲν τὴν πᾶσαν ζωὴν τῷ φυτῷ τὴν πολλήν, ἔμεινε δὲ αὐτὴ οὐ πολλὴ οὖσα, ἀλλ᾽ ἀρχὴ τῆς πολλῆς.

Καὶ θαῦμα οὐδέν. Ἢ καὶ θαῦμα, πῶς τὸ πλῆθος τῆς ζωῆς ἐξ οὐ πλήθους ἦν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν τὸ πλῆθος, εἰ μὴ τὸ πρὸ τοῦ πλήθους ἦν ὃ μὴ πλῆθος ἦν. Οὐ γὰρ μερίζεται εἰς τὸ πᾶν ἡ ἀρχή· μερισθεῖσα γὰρ ἀπώλεσεν ἂν καὶ τὸ πᾶν, καὶ οὐδ᾽ ἂν ἔτι γένοιτο μὴ μενούσης τῆς ἀρχῆς ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτῆς ἑτέρας οὔσης.

Διὸ καὶ ἡ ἀναγωγὴ πανταχοῦ ἐφ᾽ ἕν. Καὶ ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστου μέν τι ἕν, εἰς ὃ ἀνάξεις, καὶ τόδε πᾶν εἰς ἓν τὸ πρὸ αὐτοῦ, οὐχ ἁπλῶς ἕν, ἕως τις ἐπὶ τὸ ἁπλῶς ἓν ἔλθῃ· τοῦτο δὲ οὐκέτι ἐπ᾽ ἄλλο. Ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μὲν τὸ τοῦ φυτοῦ ἕν – τοῦτο δὲ καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μένουσα – καὶ τὸ ζώιου ἓν καὶ τὸ ψυχῆς ἓν καὶ τὸ τοῦ παντὸς ἓν λαμβάνοι, λαμβάνει ἑκασταχοῦ τὸ δυνατώτατον καὶ τὸ τίμιον· εἰ δὲ τὸ τῶν κατ᾽ ἀλήθειαν ὄντων ἕν, τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ πηγὴν καὶ δύναμιν, λαμβάνοι, ἀπιστήσομεν καὶ τὸ μηδὲν ὑπονοήσομεν; Ἤ ἐστι μὲν τὸ μηδὲν τούτων ὧν ἐστιν ἀρχή, τοιοῦτο μέντοι, οἷον, μηδενὸς αὐτοῦ κατηγορεῖσθαι δυναμένου, μὴ ὄντος, μὴ οὐσίας, μὴ ζωῆς, τὸ ὑπὲρ πάντα αὐτῶν εἶναι. Εἰ δὲ ἀφελὼν τὸ εἶναι λαμβάνοις, θαῦμα ἕξεις. Καὶ βαλὼν πρὸς αὐτὸ καὶ τυχὼν ἐντὸς αὐτοῦ ἀναπαυσάμενος συννόει μᾶλλον τῇ προσβολῇ συνείς, συνορῶν δὲ τὸ μέγα αὐτοῦ τοῖς μετ᾽ αὐτὸ δι᾽ αὐτὸ οὖσιν.

11 Ἔτι δὲ καὶ ὧδε· ἐπεὶ γὰρ ὁ νοῦς ἐστιν ὄψις τις καὶ ὄψις ὁρῶσα, δύναμις ἔσται εἰς ἐνέργειαν ἐλθοῦσα. Ἔσται τοίνυν τὸ μὲν ὕλη, τὸ δὲ εἶδος αὐτοῦ [οἷον καὶ ἡ κατ᾽ ἐνέργειαν ὅρασις], ὕλη δὲ ἐν νοητοῖς· ἐπεὶ καὶ ἡ ὅρασις ἡ κατ᾽ ἐνέργειαν διττὸν ἔχει· πρὶν γοῦν ἰδεῖν ἦν ἕν. Τὸ οὖν ἓν δύο γέγονε καὶ τὰ δύο ἕν. Τῇ μὲν οὖν ὁράσει ἡ πλήρωσις παρὰ τοῦ αἰσθητοῦ καὶ ἡ οἷον τελείωσις, τῇ δὲ τοῦ νοῦ ὄψει τὸ ἀγαθὸν τὸ πληροῦν. Εἰ γὰρ αὐτὸς τὸ ἀγαθόν, τί ἔδει ὁρᾶν ἢ ἐνεργεῖν ὅλως; Τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἄλλα περὶ τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ διὰ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἔχει τὴν ἐνέργειαν, τὸ δὲ ἀγαθὸν οὐδενὸς δεῖται· διὸ οὐδέν ἐστιν αὐτῷ ἢ αὐτό.

Φθεγξάμενος οὖν τὸ ἀγαθὸν μηδὲν ἔτι προσνόει· ἐὰν γάρ τι προσθῇς, ὧι προσέθηκας ὁτιοῦν, ἐνδεὲς ποιήσεις. Διὸ οὐδὲ τὸ νοεῖν, ἵνα μὴ καὶ ἄλλο, καὶ ποιήσῃς δύο, νοῦν καὶ ἀγαθόν. Ὁ μὲν γὰρ νοῦς τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ, τὸ δ᾽ ἀγαθὸν οὐ δεῖται ἐκείνου· ὅθεν καὶ τυγχάνων τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἀγαθοειδὲς γίνεται καὶ τελειοῦται παρὰ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ, τοῦ μὲν εἴδους τοῦ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ παρὰ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἥκοντος ἀγαθοειδῆ ποιοῦντος. Οἷον δὲ ἐνορᾶται ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἴχνος τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ, τοιοῦτον τὸ ἀρχέτυπον ἐννοεῖν προσήκει τὸ ἀληθινὸν ἐκείνου ἐνθυμηθέντα ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ τῷ νῷ ἐπιθέοντος ἴχνους. Τὸ μὲν οὖν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἴχνος αὐτοῦ τῷ νῷ ὁρῶντι ἔδωκεν ἔχειν· ὥστε ἐν μὲν τῷ νῷ ἡ ἔφεσις καὶ ἐφιέμενος ἀεὶ καὶ ἀεὶ τυγχάνων, ἐκεῖ[νος] δὲ οὔτε ἐφιέμενος – τίνος γάρ; – οὔτε τυγχάνων· οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐφίετο. Οὐ τοίνυν οὐδὲ νοῦς. Ἔφεσις γὰρ καὶ ἐν τούτῳ καὶ σύννευσις πρὸς τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ.

Τοῦ δὴ νοῦ καλοῦ ὄντος καὶ πάντων καλλίστου, ἐν φωτὶ καθαρῷ καὶ αὐγῇ καθαρᾶι κειμένου καὶ τὴν τῶν ὄντων περιλαβόντος φύσιν, οὗ καὶ ὁ καλὸς οὗτος κόσμος σκιὰ καὶ εἰκών, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ ἀγλαίαι κειμένου, ὅτι μηδὲν ἀνόητον μηδὲ σκοτεινὸν μηδ᾽ ἄμετρον ἐν αὐτῷ, ζῶντος ζωὴν μακαρίαν, θάμβος μὲν ἂν ἔχοι τὸν ἰδόντα καὶ τοῦτον καὶ ὡς χρὴ εἰς αὐτὸν εἰσδύντα καὶ αὐτῷ γενόμενον ἕνα. Ὡς δὴ ὁ ἀναβλέψας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὸ τῶν ἄστρων φέγγος ἰδὼν τὸν ποιήσαντα ἐνθυμεῖται καὶ ζητεῖ, οὕτω χρὴ καὶ τὸν νοητὸν κόσμον ὃς ἐθεάσατο καὶ ἐνεῖδε καὶ ἐθαύμασε τὸν κἀκείνου ποιητὴν τίς ἄρα ὁ τοιοῦτον ὑποστήσας ζητεῖν, [ἢ ποῦ] ἢ πῶς, ὁ τοιοῦτον παῖδα γεννήσας νοῦν, κόρον καλὸν καὶ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ γενόμενον κόρον. Πάντως τοι οὔτε νοῦς ἐκεῖνος οὔτε κόρος, ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸ νοῦ καὶ κόρου· μετὰ γὰρ αὐτὸν νοῦς καὶ κόρος, δεηθέντα καὶ κεκορέσθαι καὶ νενοηκέναι· ἃ πλησίον μέν ἐστι τοῦ ἀνενδεοῦς καὶ τοῦ νοεῖν οὐδὲν δεομένου, πλήρωσιν δὲ ἀληθινὴν καὶ νόησιν ἔχει, ὅτι πρώτως ἔχει. Τὸ δὲ πρὸ αὐτῶν οὔτε δεῖται οὔτε ἔχει· ἢ οὐκ ἂν τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἦν.`

    `1 Παίζοντες δὴ τὴν πρώτην πρὶν ἐπιχειρεῖν σπουδάζειν εἰ λέγοιμεν πάντα θεωρίας ἐφίεσθαι καὶ εἰς τέλος τοῦτο βλέπειν, οὐ μόνον ἔλλογα ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄλογα ζῷα καὶ τὴν ἐν φυτοῖς φύσιν καὶ τὴν ταῦτα γεννῶσαν γῆν, καὶ πάντα τυγχάνειν καθ᾽ ὅσον οἷόν τε αὐτοῖς κατὰ φύσιν ἔχοντα, ἄλλα δὲ ἄλλως καὶ θεωρεῖν καὶ τυγχάνειν καὶ τὰ μὲν ἀληθῶς, τὰ δὲ μίμησιν καὶ εἰκόνα τούτου λαμβάνοντα – ἆρ᾽ ἄν τις ἀνάσχοιτο τὸ παράδοξον τοῦ λόγου; Ἢ πρὸς ἡμᾶς αὐτοῦ γινομένου κίνδυνος οὐδεὶς ἐν τῷ παίζειν τὰ αὐτῶν γενήσεται. Ἆρ᾽ οὖν καὶ ἡμεῖς παίζοντες ἐν τῷ παρόντι θεωροῦμεν; Ἢ καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ πάντες ὅσοι παίζουσι τοῦτο ποιοῦσιν ἢ τούτου γε παίζουσιν ἐφιέμενοι. Καὶ κινδυνεύει, εἴτε τις παῖς εἴτε ἀνὴρ παίζει ἢ σπουδάζει, θεωρίας ἕνεκεν ὁ μὲν παίζειν, ὁ δὲ σπουδάζειν, καὶ πρᾶξις πᾶσα εἰς θεωρίαν τὴν σπουδὴν ἔχειν, ἡ μὲν ἀναγκαία καὶ ἐπιπλέον, τὴν θεωρίαν ἕλκουσα πρὸς τὸ ἔξω, ἡ δὲ ἑκούσιος λεγομένη ἐπ᾽ ἔλαττον μέν, ὅμως δὲ καὶ αὕτη ἐφέσει θεωρίας γινομένη. Ἀλλὰ ταῦτα μὲν ὕστερον· νῦν δὲ λέγωμεν περί τε γῆς αὐτῆς καὶ δένδρων καὶ ὅλως φυτῶν τίς αὐτῶν ἡ θεωρία, καὶ πῶς τὰ παρ᾽ αὐτῆς ποιούμενα καὶ γεννώμενα ἐπὶ τὴν τῆς θεωρίας ἀνάξομεν ἐνέργειαν, καὶ πῶς ἡ φύσις, ἣν ἀφάνταστόν φασι καὶ ἄλογον εἶναι, θεωρίαν τε ἐν αὐτῇ ἔχει καὶ ἃ ποιεῖ διὰ θεωρίαν ποιεῖ, ἣν οὐκ ἔχει [καὶ πῶς].`,
    `2 Ὅτι μὲν οὖν οὔτε χεῖρες ἐνταῦθα οὔτε πόδες οὔτε τι ὄργανον ἐπακτὸν ἢ σύμφυτον, ὕλης δὲ δεῖ, [ἐφ᾽ ἧς ποιήσει,] καθ᾽ ἣν ἐνειδοποιεῖ, παντί που δῆλον. Δεῖ δὲ καὶ τὸ μοχλεύειν ἀφελεῖν ἐκ τῆς φυσικῆς ποιήσεως. Ποῖος γὰρ ὠθισμὸς ἢ τίς μοχλεία χρώματα ποικίλα καὶ παντοδαπὰ καὶ σχήματα ποιεῖ; Ἐπεὶ οὐδὲ οἱ κηροπλάσται [ἢ κοροπλάθαι], εἰς οὓς δὴ καὶ βλέποντες ὠιήθησαν τὴν τῆς φύσεως δημιουργίαν τοιαύτην εἶναι, χρώματα δύνανται ποιεῖν μὴ χρώματα ἀλλαχόθεν ἐπάγοντες οἷς ποιοῦσιν. Ἀλλὰ γὰρ ἐχρῆν συννοοῦντας, ὡς καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τὰς τέχνας τὰς τοιαύτας μετιόντων [ὅτι] δεῖ τι ἐν αὐτοῖς μένειν, καθ᾽ ὃ μένον διὰ χειρῶν ποιήσουσιν ἃ αὐτῶν ἔργα, ἐπὶ τὸ τοιοῦτον ἀνελθεῖν τῆς φύσεως καὶ αὐτοὺς καὶ συνεῖναι, ὡς μένειν δεῖ καὶ ἐνταῦθα τὴν δύναμιν τὴν οὐ διὰ χειρῶν ποιοῦσαν καὶ πᾶσαν μένειν. Οὐ γὰρ δὴ δεῖται τῶν μὲν ὡς μενόντων, τῶν δὲ ὡς κινουμένων – ἡ γὰρ ὕλη τὸ κινούμενον, αὐτῆς δὲ οὐδὲν κινούμενον – ἢ ἐκεῖνο οὐκ ἔσται τὸ κινοῦν πρώτως, οὐδὲ ἡ φύσις τοῦτο, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀκίνητον τὸ ἐν τῷ ὅλῳ. Ὁ μὲν δὴ λόγος, φαίη ἄν τις, ἀκίνητος, αὕτη δὲ ἄλλη παρὰ τὸν λόγον καὶ κινουμένη. Ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μὲν πᾶσαν φήσουσι, καὶ ὁ λόγος· εἰ δέ τι αὐτῆς ἀκίνητον, τοῦτο καὶ ὁ λόγος. Καὶ γὰρ εἶδος αὐτὴν δεῖ εἶναι καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ὕλης καὶ εἴδους· τί γὰρ δεῖ αὐτῇ ὕλης θερμῆς ἢ ψυχρᾶς; Ἡ γὰρ ὑποκειμένη καὶ δημιουργουμένη ὕλη ἥκει τοῦτο φέρουσα, ἢ γίνεται τοιαύτη ἡ μὴ ποιότητα ἔχουσα λογωθεῖσα. Οὐ γὰρ πῦρ δεῖ προσελθεῖν, ἵνα πῦρ ἡ ὕλη γένηται, ἀλλὰ λόγον· ὃ καὶ σημεῖον οὐ μικρὸν τοῦ ἐν τοῖς ζώιοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς φυτοῖς τοὺς λόγους εἶναι τοὺς ποιοῦντας καὶ τὴν φύσιν εἶναι λόγον, ὃς ποιεῖ λόγον ἄλλον γέννημα αὐτοῦ δόντα μέν τι τῷ ὑποκειμένῳ, μένοντα δ᾽ αὐτόν. Ὁ μὲν οὖν λόγος ὁ κατὰ τὴν μορφὴν τὴν ὁρωμένην ἔσχατος ἤδη καὶ νεκρὸς καὶ οὐκέτι ποιεῖν δύναται ἄλλον, ὁ δὲ ζωὴν ἔχων ὁ τοῦ ποιήσαντος τὴν μορφὴν ἀδελφὸς ὢν καὶ αὐτὸς τὴν αὐτὴν δύναμιν ἔχων ποιεῖ ἐν τῷ γενομένῳ.`,
    `3 Πῶς οὖν ποιῶν καὶ οὕτω ποιῶν θεωρίας τινὸς ἂν ἐφάπτοιτο; Ἤ, εἰ μένων ποιεῖ καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ μένων καί ἐστι λόγος, εἴη ἂν αὐτὸς θεωρία. Ἡ μὲν γὰρ πρᾶξις γένοιτ᾽ ἂν κατὰ λόγον ἑτέρα οὖσα δηλονότι τοῦ λόγου·
    ὁ μέντοι λόγος καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ συνὼν τῇ πράξει καὶ ἐπιστατῶν οὐκ ἂν εἴη πρᾶξις. Εἰ οὖν μὴ πρᾶξις ἀλλὰ λόγος, θεωρία· καὶ ἐπὶ παντὸς λόγου ὁ μὲν ἔσχατος ἐκ θεωρίας καὶ θεωρία οὕτως ὡς τεθεωρημένος, ὁ δὲ πρὸ τούτου πᾶς ὁ μὲν ἄλλος ἄλλως, ὁ μὴ ὡς φύσις ἀλλὰ ψυχή, ὁ δ᾽ ἐν τῇ φύσει καὶ ἡ φύσις. Ἆρά γε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκ θεωρίας; Πάντως μὲν ἐκ θεωρίας. Ἀλλ᾽ εἰ καὶ αὐτὸς τεθεωρηκὼς αὑτόν; ἢ πῶς; ἔστι μὲν γὰρ ἀποτέλεσμα θεωρίας καὶ θεωρήσαντός τινος. Πῶς δὲ αὕτη ἔχει θεωρίαν; Τὴν μὲν δὴ ἐκ λόγου οὐκ ἔχει· λέγω δ᾽ ἐκ λόγου τὸ σκοπεῖσθαι περὶ τῶν ἐν αὐτῇ. Διὰ τί οὖν ζωή τις οὖσα καὶ λόγος καὶ δύναμις ποιοῦσα; Ἆρ᾽ ὅτι τὸ σκοπεῖσθαί ἐστι τὸ μήπω ἔχειν; Ἡ δὲ ἔχει, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὅτι ἔχει καὶ ποιεῖ. Τὸ οὖν εἶναι αὐτῇ ὅ ἐστι τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ ποιεῖν αὐτῇ καὶ ὅσον ἐστὶ τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ ποιοῦν. Ἔστι δὲ θεωρία καὶ θεώρημα, λόγος γάρ. Τῷ οὖν εἶναι θεωρία καὶ θεώρημα καὶ λόγος τούτῳ καὶ ποιεῖ ἧι ταῦτά ἐστιν. Ἡ ποίησις ἄρα θεωρία ἡμῖν ἀναπέφανται· ἔστι γὰρ ἀποτέλεσμα θεωρίας μενούσης θεωρίας οὐκ ἄλλο τι πραξάσης, ἀλλὰ τῷ εἶναι θεωρία ποιησάσης.`,
    `4 Καὶ εἴ τις δὲ αὐτὴν ἔροιτο τίνος ἕνεκα ποιεῖ, εἰ τοῦ ἐρωτῶντος ἐθέλοι ἐπαίειν καὶ λέγειν, εἴποι ἄν· Ἐχρῆν μὲν μὴ ἐρωτᾶν, ἀλλὰ συνιέναι καὶ αὐτὸν σιωπῇ, ὥσπερ ἐγὼ σιωπῶ καὶ οὐκ εἴθισμαι λέγειν. Τί οὖν συνιέναι; Ὅτι τὸ γενόμενόν ἐστι θέαμα ἐμὸν σιωπώσης, καὶ φύσει γενόμενον θεώρημα, καί μοι γενομένῃ ἐκ θεωρίας τῆς ὡδὶ τὴν φύσιν ἔχειν φιλοθεάμονα ὑπάρχειν. Καὶ τὸ θεωροῦν μου θεώρημα ποιεῖ, ὥσπερ οἱ γεωμέτραι θεωροῦντες γράφουσιν· ἀλλ᾽ ἐμοῦ μὴ γραφούσης, θεωρούσης δέ, ὑφίστανται αἱ τῶν σωμάτων γραμμαὶ ὥσπερ ἐκπίπτουσαι. Καί μοι τὸ τῆς μητρὸς καὶ τῶν γειναμένων ὑπάρχει πάθος· καὶ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοί εἰσιν ἐκ θεωρίας καὶ ἡ γένεσις ἡ ἐμὴ ἐκείνων οὐδὲν πραξάντων, ἀλλ᾽ ὄντων μειζόνων λόγων καὶ θεωρούντων αὑτοὺς ἐγὼ γεγέννημαι.
    Τί οὖν ταῦτα βούλεται; Ὡς ἡ μὲν λεγομένη φύσις ψυχὴ οὖσα, γέννημα ψυχῆς προτέρας δυνατώτερον ζώσης, ἡσυχῇ ἐν ἑαυτῇ θεωρίαν ἔχουσα οὐ πρὸς τὸ ἄνω οὐδ᾽ αὖ ἔτι πρὸς τὸ κάτω, στᾶσα δὲ ἐν ὧι ἔστιν, ἐν τῇ αὑτῆς στάσει καὶ οἷον συναισθήσει, τῇ συνέσει ταύτῃ καὶ συναισθήσει τὸ μετ᾽ αὐτὴν εἶδεν ὡς οἷόν τε αὐτῇ καὶ οὐκέτι ἐζήτησεν ἄλλα θεώρημα ἀποτελέσασα ἀγλαὸν καὶ χάριεν. Καὶ εἴτε τις βούλεται σύνεσίν τινα ἢ αἴσθησιν αὐτῇ διδόναι, οὐχ οἵαν λέγομεν ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων τὴν αἴσθησιν ἢ τὴν σύνεσιν, ἀλλ᾽ οἷον εἴ τις τὴν καθύπνου τῇ ἐγρηγορότος προσεικάσειε. Θεωροῦσα γὰρ θεώρημα αὐτῆς ἀναπαύεται γενόμενον αὐτῇ ἐκ τοῦ ἐν αὑτῇ καὶ σὺν αὑτῇ μένειν καὶ θεώρημα εἶναι· καὶ θεωρία ἄψοφος, ἀμυδροτέρα δέ. Ἑτέρα γὰρ αὐτῆς εἰς θέαν ἐναργεστέρα, ἡ δὲ εἴδωλον θεωρίας ἄλλης. Ταύτῃ δὴ καὶ τὸ γεννηθὲν ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἀσθενὲς παντάπασιν, ὅτι ἀσθενοῦσα θεωρία ἀσθενὲς θεώρημα ποιεῖ· ἐπεὶ καὶ ἄνθρωποι, ὅταν ἀσθενήσωσιν εἰς τὸ θεωρεῖν, σκιὰν θεωρίας καὶ λόγου τὴν πρᾶξιν ποιοῦνται. Ὅτι γὰρ μὴ ἱκανὸν αὐτοῖς τὸ τῆς θεωρίας ὑπ᾽ ἀσθενείας ψυχῆς, λαβεῖν οὐ δυνάμενοι τὸ θέαμα ἱκανῶς καὶ διὰ τοῦτο οὐ πληρούμενοι, ἐφιέμενοι δὲ αὐτὸ ἰδεῖν, εἰς πρᾶξιν φέρονται, ἵνα ἴδωσιν, ὃ μὴ νῷ ἐδύναντο. Ὅταν γοῦν ποιῶσι, καὶ αὐτοὶ ὁρᾶν βούλονται αὐτὸ καὶ θεωρεῖν καὶ αἰσθάνεσθαι καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους, ὅταν ἡ πρόθεσις αὐτοῖς ὡς οἷόν τε πρᾶξις ἦ. Πανταχοῦ δὴ ἀνευρήσομεν τὴν ποίησιν καὶ τὴν πρᾶξιν ἢ ἀσθένειαν θεωρίας ἢ παρακολούθημα· ἀσθένειαν μέν, εἰ μηδέν τις ἔχοι μετὰ τὸ πραχθέν, παρακολούθημα δέ, εἰ ἔχοι ἄλλο πρὸ τούτου κρεῖττον τοῦ ποιηθέντος θεωρεῖν. Τίς γὰρ θεωρεῖν τὸ ἀληθινὸν δυνάμενος προηγουμένως ἔρχεται ἐπὶ τὸ εἴδωλον τοῦ ἀληθινοῦ; Μαρτυροῦσι δὲ καὶ οἱ νωθέστεροι τῶν παίδων, οἳ πρὸς τὰς μαθήσεις καὶ θεωρίας ἀδυνάτως ἔχοντες ἐπὶ τὰς τέχνας καὶ τὰς ἐργασίας καταφέρονται.`,
    `5  Ἀλλὰ περὶ μὲν φύσεως εἰπόντες ὃν τρόπον θεωρία ἡ γένεσις, ἐπὶ τὴν ψυχὴν τὴν πρὸ ταύτης ἐλθόντες λέγωμεν, ὡς ἡ ταύτης θεωρία καὶ τὸ φιλομαθὲς καὶ τὸ ζητητικὸν καὶ ἡ ἐξ ὧν ἐγνώκει ὠδὶς καὶ τὸ πλῆρες πεποίηκεν αὐτὴν θεώρημα πᾶν γενομένην ἄλλο θεώρημα ποιῆσαι· οἷον ἡ τέχνη ποιεῖ· ὅταν ἑκάστη πλήρης ἦ, ἄλλην οἵαν μικρὰν τέχνην ποιεῖ ἐν παιγνίῳ ἴνδαλμα ἔχοντι ἁπάντων· ἄλλως μέντοι ταῦτα ὥσπερ ἀμυδρὰ καὶ οὐ δυνάμενα βοηθεῖν ἑαυτοῖς θεάματα καὶ θεωρήματα. Τὸ πρῶτον. [Τὸ λογιστικὸν] οὖν αὐτῆς ἄνω πρὸς τὸ ἄνω ἀεὶ πληρούμενον καὶ ἐλλαμπόμενον μένει ἐκεῖ, τὸ δὲ τῇ τοῦ μεταλαβόντος πρώτῃ μεταλήψει μεταλαμβάνον [πρόεισι]· πρόεισι γὰρ ἀεὶ ζωὴ ἐκ ζωῆς· ἐνέργεια γὰρ πανταχοῦ φθάνει καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅτου ἀποστατεῖ. Προιοῦσα μέντοι ἐᾶι τὸ πρότερον [τὸ ἑαυτῆς πρόσθεν] μέρος οὗ καταλέλοιπε μένειν· ἀπολιποῦσα γὰρ τὸ [ἑαυτῆς] πρόσθεν οὐκέτι ἔσται πανταχοῦ, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν ὧι τελευτᾶι μόνον. Οὐκ ἴσον δὲ τὸ προιὸν τῷ μείναντι. Εἰ οὖν πανταχοῦ δεῖ γίνεσθαι καὶ μὴ εἶναι ὅπου μὴ τὴν ἐνέργειαν τὴν αὐτὴν ἀεί τε τὸ πρότερον ἕτερον τοῦ ὑστέρου, ἥκει δὲ ἡ ἐνέργεια ἐκ θεωρίας ἢ πράξεως, πρᾶξις δὲ οὔπω ἦν – οὐ γὰρ οἷόν τε πρὸ θεωρίας – ἀνάγκη ἀσθενεστέραν μὲν ἑτέραν ἑτέρας εἶναι, πᾶσαν δὲ θεωρίαν· ὥστε τὴν κατὰ τὴν θεωρίαν πρᾶξιν δοκοῦσαν εἶναι τὴν ἀσθενεστάτην θεωρίαν εἶναι· ὁμογενὲς γὰρ ἀεὶ δεῖ τὸ γεννώμενον εἶναι, ἀσθενέστερον μὴν τῷ ἐξίτηλον καταβαῖνον γίγνεσθαι. Ἀψοφητὶ μὲν δὴ πάντα, ὅτι μηδὲν ἐμφανοῦς καὶ τῆς ἔξωθεν θεωρίας ἢ πράξεως δεῖται, καὶ ψυχὴ δὲ ἡ θεωροῦσα καὶ τὸ οὕτω θεωρῆσαν ἅτε ἐξωτέρω καὶ οὐχ ὡσαύτως τῷ πρὸ αὐτῆς τὸ μετ᾽ αὐτὴν ποιεῖ· καὶ θεωρία τὴν θεωρίαν ποιεῖ. Καὶ γὰρ οὐκ ἔχει πέρας ἡ θεωρία οὐδὲ τὸ θεώρημα. Διὰ τοῦτο δέ· [ἢ καὶ διὰ τοῦτο] πανταχοῦ· ποῦ γὰρ οὐχί; Ἐπεὶ καὶ ἐν πάσῃ ψυχῇ τὸ αὐτό. Οὐ γὰρ περιγέγραπται μεγέθει. Οὐ μὴν ὡσαύτως ἐν πᾶσιν, ὥστε οὐδὲ ἐν παντὶ μέρει ψυχῆς ὁμοίως. Διὸ ὁ ἡνίοχος τοῖς ἵπποις δίδωσιν ὧν εἶδεν, οἱ δὲ λαβόντες δηλονότι ὀρέγοιντο ἂν ὧν εἶδον· ἔλαβον γὰρ οὐ πᾶν. Ὀρεγόμενοι δὲ εἰ πράττοιεν, οὗ ὀρέγονται ἕνεκα πράττουσιν. Ἦν δὲ θεώρημα καὶ θεωρία ἐκεῖνο.`,
    `6 Ἡ ἄρα πρᾶξις ἕνεκα θεωρίας καὶ θεωρήματος· ὥστε καὶ τοῖς πράττουσιν ἡ θεωρία τέλος, καὶ οἷον ἐξ εὐθείας ὃ μὴ ἠδυνήθησαν λαβεῖν τοῦτο περιπλανώμενοι ἑλεῖν ζητοῦσι. Καὶ γὰρ αὖ ὅταν τύχωσιν οὗ βούλονται, ὃ γενέσθαι ἠθέλησαν, οὐχ ἵνα μὴ γνῶσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἵνα γνῶσι καὶ παρὸν ἴδωσιν ἐν ψυχῇ, δῆλον ὅτι κείμενον θεατόν. Ἐπεὶ καὶ ἀγαθοῦ χάριν πράττουσι· τοῦτο δὲ οὐχ ἵνα ἔξω αὐτῶν, οὐδ᾽ ἵνα μὴ ἔχωσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἵνα ἔχωσι τὸ ἐκ τῆς πράξεως ἀγαθόν. Τοῦτο δὲ ποῦ; Ἐν ψυχῇ. Ἀνέκαμψεν οὖν πάλιν ἡ πρᾶξις εἰς θεωρίαν· ὃ γὰρ ἐν ψυχῇ λαμβάνει λόγῳ οὔσῃ, τί ἂν ἄλλο ἢ λόγος σιωπῶν εἴη; Καὶ μᾶλλον, ὅσῳ μᾶλλον. Τότε γὰρ καὶ ἡσυχίαν ἄγει καὶ οὐδὲν ζητεῖ ὡς πληρωθεῖσα, καὶ ἡ θεωρία ἡ ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ τῷ πιστεύειν ἔχειν εἴσω κεῖται. Καὶ ὅσῳ ἐναργεστέρα ἡ πίστις, ἡσυχαιτέρα καὶ ἡ θεωρία, ἧι μᾶλλον εἰς ἓν ἄγει, καὶ τὸ γινῶσκον ὅσῳ γινώσκει – ἤδη γὰρ σπουδαστέον – εἰς ἓν τῷ γνωσθέντι ἔρχεται. Εἰ γὰρ δύο, τὸ μὲν ἄλλο, τὸ δὲ ἄλλο ἔσται· ὥστε οἷον παράκειται, καὶ τὸ διπλοῦν τοῦτο οὔπω ὠικείωσεν, οἷον ὅταν ἐνόντες λόγοι ἐν ψυχῇ μηδὲν ποιῶσι. Διὸ δεῖ μὴ ἔξωθεν τὸν λόγον εἶναι, ἀλλ᾽ ἑνωθῆναι τῇ ψυχῇ τοῦ μανθάνοντος, ἕως ἂν οἰκεῖον εὕρῃ. Ἡ μὲν οὖν ψυχή, ὅταν οἰκειωθῇ καὶ διατεθῇ, ὅμως προφέρει καὶ προχειρίζεται – οὐ γὰρ πρώτως εἶχε – καὶ καταμανθάνει, καὶ τῇ προχειρίσει οἷον ἑτέρα αὐτοῦ γίνεται, καὶ διανοουμένη βλέπει ὡς ἄλλο ὂν ἄλλο· καίτοι καὶ αὕτη λόγος ἦν καὶ οἷον νοῦς, ἀλλ᾽ ὁρῶν ἄλλο. Ἔστι γὰρ οὐ πλήρης, ἀλλὰ ἐλλείπει τῷ πρὸ αὐτῆς· ὁρᾶι μέντοι καὶ αὐτὴ ἡσύχως ἃ προφέρει. Ἃ μὲν γὰρ εὖ προήνεγκεν, οὐκέτι προφέρει, ἃ δὲ προφέρει, τῷ ἐλλιπεῖ προφέρει εἰς ἐπίσκεψιν καταμανθάνουσα ὃ ἔχει. Ἐν δὲ τοῖς πρακτικοῖς ἐφαρμόττει ἃ ἔχει τοῖς ἔξω. Καὶ τῷ μὲν μᾶλλον ἔχειν ἢ ἡ φύσις ἡσυχαιτέρα, καὶ τῷ πλέον θεωρητικὴ μᾶλλον, τῷ δὲ μὴ τελέως ἐφιεμένη μᾶλλον ἔχειν τὴν τοῦ θεωρηθέντος καταμάθησιν καὶ θεωρίαν τὴν ἐξ ἐπισκέψεως. Καὶ ἀπολείπουσα δὲ καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις γινομένη, εἶτ᾽ ἐπανιοῦσα πάλιν, θεωρεῖ τῷ ἀπολειφθέντι αὐτῆς μέρει· ἡ δὲ στᾶσα ἐν αὑτῇ ἧττον τοῦτο ποιεῖ. Διὸ ὁ σπουδαῖος λελόγισται ἤδη καὶ τὸ παρ᾽ αὑτοῦ πρὸς ἄλλον ἀποφαίνει· πρὸς δὲ αὑτὸν ὄψις. Ἤδη γὰρ οὗτος πρὸς τὸ ἓν καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἥσυχον οὐ μόνον τῶν ἔξω, ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς αὑτόν, καὶ πάντα εἴσω.`,
    `7 Ὅτι μὲν οὖν πάντα τά τε ὡς ἀληθῶς ὄντα ἐκ θεωρίας καὶ θεωρία, καὶ τὰ ἐξ ἐκείνων γενόμενα θεωρούντων ἐκείνων καὶ αὐτὰ θεωρήματα, τὰ μὲν αἰσθήσει τὰ δὲ γνώσει ἢ δόξῃ, καὶ αἱ πράξεις τὸ τέλος ἔχουσιν εἰς γνῶσιν καὶ ἡ ἔφεσις γνώσεως καὶ αἱ γεννήσεις ἀπὸ θεωρίας εἰς ἀποτελεύτησιν εἴδους καὶ θεωρήματος ἄλλου, καὶ ὅλως μιμήματα ὄντα ἕκαστα τῶν ποιούντων θεωρήματα ποιεῖ καὶ εἴδη, καὶ αἱ γινόμεναι ὑποστάσεις μιμήσεις ὄντων οὖσαι ποιοῦντα δείκνυσι τέλος ποιούμενα οὐ τὰς ποιήσεις οὐδὲ τὰς πράξεις, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀποτέλεσμα ἵνα θεωρηθῇ, καὶ τοῦτο καὶ αἱ διανοήσεις ἰδεῖν θέλουσι καὶ ἔτι πρότερον αἱ αἰσθήσεις, αἷς τέλος ἡ γνῶσις, καὶ ἔτι πρὸ τούτων ἡ φύσις τὸ θεώρημα τὸ ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ τὸν λόγον ποιεῖ ἄλλον λόγον ἀποτελοῦσα – τὰ μὲν ἦν αὐτόθεν λαβεῖν, τὰ δ᾽ ὑπέμνησεν ὁ λόγος – δῆλόν που. Ἐπεὶ κἀκεῖνο δῆλον, ὡς ἀναγκαῖον ἦν τῶν πρώτων ἐν θεωρίαι ὄντων καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πάντα ἐφίεσθαι τούτου, εἴπερ τέλος ἅπασιν ἡ ἀρχή.
    Ἐπεὶ καί, ὅταν τὰ ζῷα γεννᾶι, οἱ λόγοι ἔνδον ὄντες κινοῦσι, καὶ ἔστιν ἐνέργεια θεωρίας τοῦτο καὶ ὠδὶς τοῦ πολλὰ ποιεῖν εἴδη καὶ πολλὰ θεωρήματα καὶ λόγων πληρῶσαι πάντα καὶ οἷον ἀεὶ θεωρεῖν· τὸ γὰρ ποιεῖν εἶναί τι εἶδός ἐστι ποιεῖν, τοῦτο δέ ἐστι πάντα πληρῶσαι θεωρίας. Καὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι δέ, αἵ τε ἐν τοῖς γινομένοις αἵ τε ἐν τοῖς πραττομένοις, θεωρούντων εἰσὶν ἐκ τοῦ θεωρητοῦ παραφορᾶι· καὶ ὅ γε κακὸς τεχνίτης ἔοικεν αἰσχρὰ εἴδη ποιοῦντι. Καὶ οἱ ἐρῶντες δὲ ἰδόντων καὶ πρὸς εἶδος σπευδόντων.`,
    `8 Ταῦτα μὲν οὕτω. Τῆς δὲ θεωρίας ἀναβαινούσης ἐκ τῆς φύσεως ἐπὶ ψυχὴν καὶ ἀπὸ ταύτης εἰς νοῦν καὶ ἀεὶ οἰκειοτέρων τῶν θεωριῶν γιγνομένων καὶ ἑνουμένων τοῖς θεωροῦσι καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς σπουδαίας ψυχῆς πρὸς τὸ αὐτὸ τῷ ὑποκειμένῳ ἰόντων τῶν ἐγνωσμένων ἅτε εἰς νοῦν σπευδόντων, ἐπὶ τούτου δηλονότι ἤδη ἓν ἄμφω οὐκ οἰκειώσει, ὥσπερ ἐπὶ τῆς ψυχῆς τῆς ἀρίστης, ἀλλ᾽ οὐσίαι καὶ τῷ ταὐτὸν τὸ εἶναι καὶ τὸ νοεῖν εἶναι. Οὐ γὰρ ἔτι ἄλλο, τὸ δ᾽ ἄλλο· πάλιν γὰρ αὖ ἄλλο ἔσται, ὃ οὐκέτι ἄλλο καὶ ἄλλο. Δεῖ οὖν τοῦτο εἶναι ἓν ὄντως ἄμφω· τοῦτο δέ ἐστι θεωρία ζῶσα, οὐ θεώρημα, οἷον τὸ ἐν ἄλλῳ. Τὸ γὰρ ἐν ἄλλῳ ζῶν δι᾽ ἐκεῖνο, οὐκ αὐτοζῶν. Εἰ οὖν ζήσεταί τι θεώρημα καὶ νόημα, δεῖ αὐτοζωὴν εἶναι οὐ φυτικὴν οὐδὲ αἰσθητικὴν οὐδὲ ψυχικὴν τὴν ἄλλην. Νοήσεις μὲν γάρ πως καὶ ἄλλαι· ἀλλ᾽ ἡ μὲν φυτικὴ νόησις, ἡ δὲ αἰσθητική, ἡ δὲ ψυχική. Πῶς οὖν νοήσεις; Ὅτι λόγοι.
    Καὶ πᾶσα ζωὴ νόησίς τις, ἀλλὰ ἄλλη ἄλλης ἀμυδροτέρα, ὥσπερ καὶ ζωή. Ἡ δὲ ἐναργεστέρα· αὕτη καὶ πρώτη ζωὴ καὶ πρῶτος νοῦς εἷς. Νόησις οὖν ἡ πρώτη ζωὴ καὶ ζωὴ δευτέρα νόησις δευτέρα καὶ ἡ ἐσχάτη ζωὴ ἐσχάτη νόησις. Πᾶσα οὖν ζωὴ τοῦ γένους τούτου καὶ νόησις. Ἀλλὰ ζωῆς μὲν ἴσως διαφορὰς τάχ᾽ ἂν λέγοιεν ἄνθρωποι, νοήσεων δὲ οὐ λέγουσιν, ἀλλὰ τὰς μέν, τὰς δ᾽ ὅλως οὐ νοήσεις, ὅτι ὅλως τὴν ζωὴν ὅ τι ποτέ ἐστιν οὐ ζητοῦσιν. Ἀλλ᾽ ἐκεῖνό γε ἐπισημαντέον, ὅτι πάλιν αὖ ὁ λόγος πάρεργον ἐνδείκνυται θεωρίας τὰ πάντα ὄντα. Εἰ τοίνυν ἡ ζωὴ ἡ ἀληθεστάτη νοήσει ζωή ἐστιν, αὕτη δὲ ταὐτὸν τῇ ἀληθεστάτῃ νοήσει, ἡ ἀληθεστάτη νόησις ζῇ καὶ ἡ θεωρία καὶ τὸ θεώρημα τὸ τοιοῦτο ζῶν καὶ ζωὴ καὶ ἓν ὁμοῦ τὰ δύο. Ἓν οὖν ὂν τὰ δύο πῶς αὖ πολλὰ τοῦτο τὸ ἕν;
    Ἢ ὅτι οὐχ ἓν θεωρεῖ. Ἐπεὶ καὶ ὅταν τὸ ἓν θεωρῇ, οὐχ ὡς ἕν· εἰ δὲ μή, οὐ γίνεται νοῦς. Ἀλλὰ ἀρξάμενος ὡς ἓν οὐχ ὡς ἤρξατο ἔμεινεν, ἀλλ᾽ ἔλαθεν ἑαυτὸν πολὺς γενόμενος, οἷον βεβαρημένος, καὶ ἐξείλιξεν αὑτὸν πάντα ἔχειν θέλων – ὡς βέλτιον ἦν αὐτῷ μὴ ἐθελῆσαι τοῦτο, δεύτερον γὰρ ἐγένετο – οἷον γὰρ κύκλος ἐξελίξας αὑτὸν γέγονε καὶ σχῆμα καὶ ἐπίπεδον καὶ περιφέρεια καὶ κέντρον καὶ γραμμαὶ καὶ τὰ μὲν ἄνω, τὰ δὲ κάτω· βελτίω μὲν ὅθεν, χείρω δὲ εἰς ὅ. Τὸ γὰρ εἰς ὃ οὐκ ἦν τοιοῦτον οἷον τὸ ἀφ᾽ οὗ καὶ εἰς ὅ, οὐδ᾽ αὖ τὸ ἀφ᾽ οὗ καὶ εἰς ὃ οἷον τὸ ἀφ᾽ οὗ μόνον. Καὶ ἄλλως δὲ ὁ νοῦς οὐχ ἑνός τινος νοῦς, ἀλλὰ καὶ πᾶς· πᾶς δὲ ὢν καὶ πάντων. Δεῖ οὖν αὐτὸν πάντα ὄντα καὶ πάντων καὶ τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ ἔχειν πᾶν καὶ πάντα· εἰ δὲ μή, ἕξει τι μέρος οὐ νοῦν, καὶ συγκείσεται ἐξ οὐ νῶν, καὶ σωρός τις συμφορητὸς ἔσται ἀναμένων τὸ γενέσθαι νοῦς ἐκ πάντων. Διὸ καὶ ἄπειρος οὕτως καί, εἴ τι ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἠλάττωται, οὔτε τὸ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι πάντα καὶ αὐτό, οὔτε ἐκεῖνος ὁ ἐξ οὗ, ὅτι μὴ σύνθεσις ἦν ἐκ μορίων.`,
    `9 Οὗτος μὲν οὖν τοιοῦτος· διὸ οὐ πρῶτος, ἀλλὰ δεῖ εἶναι τὸ ἐπέκεινα αὐτοῦ, οὗπερ χάριν καὶ οἱ πρόσθεν λόγοι, πρῶτον μέν, ὅτι πλῆθος ἑνὸς ὕστερον· καὶ ἀριθμὸς δὲ οὗτος, ἀριθμοῦ δὲ ἀρχὴ καὶ τοῦ τοιούτου τὸ ὄντως ἕν· καὶ οὗτος νοῦς καὶ νοητὸν ἅμα, ὥστε δύο ἅμα.
    Εἰ δὲ δύο, δεῖ τὸ πρὸ τοῦ δύο λαβεῖν. Τί οὖν; Νοῦς μόνον; Ἀλλὰ παντὶ νῷ συνέζευκται τὸ νοητόν· εἰ οὖν δεῖ μὴ συνεζεῦχθαι τὸ νοητόν, οὐδὲ νοῦς ἔσται. Εἰ οὖν μὴ νοῦς, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκφεύξεται τὰ δύο, τὸ πρότερον τῶν δύο τούτων ἐπέκεινα νοῦ εἶναι. Τί οὖν κωλύει τὸ νοητὸν αὐτὸ εἶναι; Ἢ ὅτι καὶ τὸ νοητὸν συνέζευκτο τῷ νῷ. Εἰ οὖν μήτε νοῦς μήτε νοητὸν εἴη, τί ἂν εἴη; Ἐξ οὗ ὁ νοῦς καὶ τὸ σὺν αὐτῷ νοητὸν φήσομεν.
    Τί οὖν τοῦτο καὶ ποῖόν τι αὐτὸ φαντασθησόμεθα; Καὶ γὰρ αὖ ἢ νοοῦν ἔσται ἢ ἀνόητόν τι. Νοοῦν μὲν οὖν νοῦς, ἀνόητον δὲ ἀγνοήσει καὶ ἑαυτό· ὥστε τί σεμνόν; Οὐδὲ γάρ, εἰ λέγοιμεν τὸ ἀγαθὸν εἶναι καὶ ἁπλούστατον εἶναι, δῆλόν τι καὶ σαφὲς ἐροῦμεν τὸ ἀληθὲς λέγοντες, ἕως ἂν μὴ ἔχωμεν ἐπὶ τί ἐρείδοντες τὴν διάνοιαν λέγομεν. Καὶ γὰρ αὖ τῆς γνώσεως διὰ νοῦ τῶν ἄλλων γινομένης καὶ τῷ νῷ νοῦν γινώσκειν δυναμένων ὑπερβεβηκὸς τοῦτο τὴν νοῦ φύσιν τίνι ἂν ἁλίσκοιτο ἐπιβολῇ ἀθρόαι; Πρὸς ὃν δεῖ σημῆναι, ὅπως οἷόν τε, τῷ ἐν ἡμῖν ὁμοίῳ φήσομεν. Ἔστι γάρ τι καὶ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν αὐτοῦ· ἢ οὐκ ἔστιν, ὅπου μὴ ἔστιν, οἷς ἐστι μετέχειν αὐτοῦ. Τὸ γὰρ πανταχοῦ παρὸν στήσας ὁπουοῦν τὸ δυνάμενον ἔχειν ἔχεις ἐκεῖθεν· ὥσπερ εἰ φωνῆς κατεχούσης ἐρημίαν ἢ καὶ μετὰ τῆς ἐρημίας καὶ ἀνθρώπους ἐν ὁτῳοῦν τοῦ ἐρήμου στήσας οὖς τὴν φωνὴν κομιεῖ πᾶσαν καὶ αὖ οὐ πᾶσαν. Τί οὖν ἐστιν ὃ κομιούμεθα νοῦν παραστησάμενοι; Ἢ δεῖ τὸν νοῦν οἷον εἰς τοὐπίσω ἀναχωρεῖν καὶ οἷον ἑαυτὸν ἀφέντα τοῖς εἰς ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ ἀμφίστομον ὄντα, κἀκεῖνα, εἰ ἐθέλοι ἐκεῖνο ὁρᾶν, μὴ πάντα νοῦν εἶναι. Ἔστι μὲν γὰρ αὐτὸς ζωὴ πρώτη, ἐνέργεια οὖσα ἐν διεξόδῳ τῶν πάντων· διεξόδῳ δὲ οὐ τῇ διεξιούσῃ, ἀλλὰ τῇ διεξελθούσῃ. Εἴπερ οὖν καὶ ζωή ἐστι καὶ διέξοδός ἐστι καὶ πάντα ἀκριβῶς καὶ οὐχ ὁλοσχερῶς ἔχει – ἀτελῶς γὰρ ἂν καὶ ἀδιαρθρώτως ἔχοι – ἔκ τινος ἄλλου αὐτὸν εἶναι, ὃ οὐκέτι ἐν διεξόδῳ, ἀλλὰ ἀρχὴ διεξόδου καὶ ἀρχὴ ζωῆς καὶ ἀρχὴ νοῦ καὶ τῶν πάντων. Οὐ γὰρ ἀρχὴ τὰ πάντα, ἀλλ᾽ ἐξ ἀρχῆς τὰ πάντα, αὕτη δὲ οὐκέτι τὰ πάντα οὐδέ τι τῶν πάντων, ἵνα γεννήσῃ τὰ πάντα, καὶ ἵνα μὴ πλῆθος ἦ, ἀλλὰ τοῦ πλήθους ἀρχή· τοῦ γὰρ γεννηθέντος πανταχοῦ τὸ γεννῶν ἁπλούστερον. Εἰ οὖν τοῦτο νοῦν ἐγέννησεν, ἁπλούστερον νοῦ δεῖ αὐτὸ εἶναι. Εἰ δέ τις οἴοιτο αὐτὸ τὸ ἓν καὶ τὰ πάντα εἶναι, ἤτοι καθ᾽ ἓν ἕκαστον τῶν πάντων ἐκεῖνο ἔσται ἢ ὁμοῦ πάντα. Εἰ μὲν οὖν ὁμοῦ πάντα συνηθροισμένα, ὕστερον ἔσται τῶν πάντων· εἰ δὲ πρότερον τῶν πάντων, ἄλλα μὲν τὰ πάντα, ἄλλο δὲ αὐτὸ ἔσται τῶν πάντων· εἰ δὲ ἅμα καὶ αὐτὸ καὶ τὰ πάντα, οὐκ ἀρχὴ ἔσται. Δεῖ δὲ αὐτὸ ἀρχὴν εἶναι καὶ εἶναι πρὸ πάντων, ἵνα ἦ μετ᾽ αὐτὸ καὶ τὰ πάντα. Τὸ δὲ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον τῶν πάντων πρῶτον μὲν τὸ αὐτὸ ἔσται ὁτιοῦν ὁτῳοῦν, ἔπειτα ὁμοῦ πάντα, καὶ οὐδὲν διακρινεῖ. Καὶ οὕτως οὐδὲν τῶν πάντων, ἀλλὰ πρὸ τῶν πάντων.`,
    `10 Τί δὴ ὄν; Δύναμις τῶν πάντων· ἧς μὴ οὔσης οὐδ᾽ ἂν τὰ πάντα, οὐδ᾽ ἂν νοῦς ζωὴ ἡ πρώτη καὶ πᾶσα. Τὸ δὲ ὑπὲρ τὴν ζωὴν αἴτιον ζωῆς· οὐ γὰρ ἡ τῆς ζωῆς ἐνέργεια τὰ πάντα οὖσα πρώτη, ἀλλ᾽ ὥσπερ προχυθεῖσα αὐτὴ οἷον ἐκ πηγῆς.
    Νόησον γὰρ πηγὴν ἀρχὴν ἄλλην οὐκ ἔχουσαν, δοῦσαν δὲ ποταμοῖς πᾶσαν αὑτήν, οὐκ ἀναλωθεῖσαν τοῖς ποταμοῖς, ἀλλὰ μένουσαν αὐτὴν ἡσύχως, τοὺς δὲ ἐξ αὐτῆς προεληλυθότας πρὶν ἄλλον ἄλλῃ ῥεῖν ὁμοῦ συνόντας ἔτι, ἤδη δὲ οἷον ἑκάστους εἰδότας οἷ ἀφήσουσιν αὐτῶν τὰ ῥεύματα·
    ἢ ζωὴν φυτοῦ μεγίστου διὰ παντὸς ἐλθοῦσαν ἀρχῆς μενούσης καὶ οὐ σκεδασθείσης περὶ πᾶν αὐτῆς οἷον ἐν ῥίζῃ ἱδρυμένης. Αὕτη τοίνυν παρέσχε μὲν τὴν πᾶσαν ζωὴν τῷ φυτῷ τὴν πολλήν, ἔμεινε δὲ αὐτὴ οὐ πολλὴ οὖσα, ἀλλ᾽ ἀρχὴ τῆς πολλῆς.
    Καὶ θαῦμα οὐδέν. Ἢ καὶ θαῦμα, πῶς τὸ πλῆθος τῆς ζωῆς ἐξ οὐ πλήθους ἦν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν τὸ πλῆθος, εἰ μὴ τὸ πρὸ τοῦ πλήθους ἦν ὃ μὴ πλῆθος ἦν. Οὐ γὰρ μερίζεται εἰς τὸ πᾶν ἡ ἀρχή· μερισθεῖσα γὰρ ἀπώλεσεν ἂν καὶ τὸ πᾶν, καὶ οὐδ᾽ ἂν ἔτι γένοιτο μὴ μενούσης τῆς ἀρχῆς ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτῆς ἑτέρας οὔσης.
    Διὸ καὶ ἡ ἀναγωγὴ πανταχοῦ ἐφ᾽ ἕν. Καὶ ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστου μέν τι ἕν, εἰς ὃ ἀνάξεις, καὶ τόδε πᾶν εἰς ἓν τὸ πρὸ αὐτοῦ, οὐχ ἁπλῶς ἕν, ἕως τις ἐπὶ τὸ ἁπλῶς ἓν ἔλθῃ· τοῦτο δὲ οὐκέτι ἐπ᾽ ἄλλο. Ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μὲν τὸ τοῦ φυτοῦ ἕν – τοῦτο δὲ καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μένουσα – καὶ τὸ ζώιου ἓν καὶ τὸ ψυχῆς ἓν καὶ τὸ τοῦ παντὸς ἓν λαμβάνοι, λαμβάνει ἑκασταχοῦ τὸ δυνατώτατον καὶ τὸ τίμιον· εἰ δὲ τὸ τῶν κατ᾽ ἀλήθειαν ὄντων ἕν, τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ πηγὴν καὶ δύναμιν, λαμβάνοι, ἀπιστήσομεν καὶ τὸ μηδὲν ὑπονοήσομεν; Ἤ ἐστι μὲν τὸ μηδὲν τούτων ὧν ἐστιν ἀρχή, τοιοῦτο μέντοι, οἷον, μηδενὸς αὐτοῦ κατηγορεῖσθαι δυναμένου, μὴ ὄντος, μὴ οὐσίας, μὴ ζωῆς, τὸ ὑπὲρ πάντα αὐτῶν εἶναι. Εἰ δὲ ἀφελὼν τὸ εἶναι λαμβάνοις, θαῦμα ἕξεις. Καὶ βαλὼν πρὸς αὐτὸ καὶ τυχὼν ἐντὸς αὐτοῦ ἀναπαυσάμενος συννόει μᾶλλον τῇ προσβολῇ συνείς, συνορῶν δὲ τὸ μέγα αὐτοῦ τοῖς μετ᾽ αὐτὸ δι᾽ αὐτὸ οὖσιν.`,
    `11 Ἔτι δὲ καὶ ὧδε· ἐπεὶ γὰρ ὁ νοῦς ἐστιν ὄψις τις καὶ ὄψις ὁρῶσα, δύναμις ἔσται εἰς ἐνέργειαν ἐλθοῦσα. Ἔσται τοίνυν τὸ μὲν ὕλη, τὸ δὲ εἶδος αὐτοῦ [οἷον καὶ ἡ κατ᾽ ἐνέργειαν ὅρασις], ὕλη δὲ ἐν νοητοῖς· ἐπεὶ καὶ ἡ ὅρασις ἡ κατ᾽ ἐνέργειαν διττὸν ἔχει· πρὶν γοῦν ἰδεῖν ἦν ἕν. Τὸ οὖν ἓν δύο γέγονε καὶ τὰ δύο ἕν. Τῇ μὲν οὖν ὁράσει ἡ πλήρωσις παρὰ τοῦ αἰσθητοῦ καὶ ἡ οἷον τελείωσις, τῇ δὲ τοῦ νοῦ ὄψει τὸ ἀγαθὸν τὸ πληροῦν. Εἰ γὰρ αὐτὸς τὸ ἀγαθόν, τί ἔδει ὁρᾶν ἢ ἐνεργεῖν ὅλως; Τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἄλλα περὶ τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ διὰ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἔχει τὴν ἐνέργειαν, τὸ δὲ ἀγαθὸν οὐδενὸς δεῖται· διὸ οὐδέν ἐστιν αὐτῷ ἢ αὐτό.
    Φθεγξάμενος οὖν τὸ ἀγαθὸν μηδὲν ἔτι προσνόει· ἐὰν γάρ τι προσθῇς, ὧι προσέθηκας ὁτιοῦν, ἐνδεὲς ποιήσεις. Διὸ οὐδὲ τὸ νοεῖν, ἵνα μὴ καὶ ἄλλο, καὶ ποιήσῃς δύο, νοῦν καὶ ἀγαθόν. Ὁ μὲν γὰρ νοῦς τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ, τὸ δ᾽ ἀγαθὸν οὐ δεῖται ἐκείνου· ὅθεν καὶ τυγχάνων τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἀγαθοειδὲς γίνεται καὶ τελειοῦται παρὰ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ, τοῦ μὲν εἴδους τοῦ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ παρὰ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἥκοντος ἀγαθοειδῆ ποιοῦντος. Οἷον δὲ ἐνορᾶται ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἴχνος τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ, τοιοῦτον τὸ ἀρχέτυπον ἐννοεῖν προσήκει τὸ ἀληθινὸν ἐκείνου ἐνθυμηθέντα ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ τῷ νῷ ἐπιθέοντος ἴχνους. Τὸ μὲν οὖν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἴχνος αὐτοῦ τῷ νῷ ὁρῶντι ἔδωκεν ἔχειν· ὥστε ἐν μὲν τῷ νῷ ἡ ἔφεσις καὶ ἐφιέμενος ἀεὶ καὶ ἀεὶ τυγχάνων, ἐκεῖ[νος] δὲ οὔτε ἐφιέμενος – τίνος γάρ; – οὔτε τυγχάνων· οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐφίετο. Οὐ τοίνυν οὐδὲ νοῦς. Ἔφεσις γὰρ καὶ ἐν τούτῳ καὶ σύννευσις πρὸς τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ.
    Τοῦ δὴ νοῦ καλοῦ ὄντος καὶ πάντων καλλίστου, ἐν φωτὶ καθαρῷ καὶ αὐγῇ καθαρᾶι κειμένου καὶ τὴν τῶν ὄντων περιλαβόντος φύσιν, οὗ καὶ ὁ καλὸς οὗτος κόσμος σκιὰ καὶ εἰκών, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ ἀγλαίαι κειμένου, ὅτι μηδὲν ἀνόητον μηδὲ σκοτεινὸν μηδ᾽ ἄμετρον ἐν αὐτῷ, ζῶντος ζωὴν μακαρίαν, θάμβος μὲν ἂν ἔχοι τὸν ἰδόντα καὶ τοῦτον καὶ ὡς χρὴ εἰς αὐτὸν εἰσδύντα καὶ αὐτῷ γενόμενον ἕνα. Ὡς δὴ ὁ ἀναβλέψας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὸ τῶν ἄστρων φέγγος ἰδὼν τὸν ποιήσαντα ἐνθυμεῖται καὶ ζητεῖ, οὕτω χρὴ καὶ τὸν νοητὸν κόσμον ὃς ἐθεάσατο καὶ ἐνεῖδε καὶ ἐθαύμασε τὸν κἀκείνου ποιητὴν τίς ἄρα ὁ τοιοῦτον ὑποστήσας ζητεῖν, [ἢ ποῦ] ἢ πῶς, ὁ τοιοῦτον παῖδα γεννήσας νοῦν, κόρον καλὸν καὶ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ γενόμενον κόρον. Πάντως τοι οὔτε νοῦς ἐκεῖνος οὔτε κόρος, ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸ νοῦ καὶ κόρου· μετὰ γὰρ αὐτὸν νοῦς καὶ κόρος, δεηθέντα καὶ κεκορέσθαι καὶ νενοηκέναι· ἃ πλησίον μέν ἐστι τοῦ ἀνενδεοῦς καὶ τοῦ νοεῖν οὐδὲν δεομένου, πλήρωσιν δὲ ἀληθινὴν καὶ νόησιν ἔχει, ὅτι πρώτως ἔχει. Τὸ δὲ πρὸ αὐτῶν οὔτε δεῖται οὔτε ἔχει· ἢ οὐκ ἂν τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἦν.`

export const plotinus_e3_c8_eng_text = `1. Starting out by playing before getting into serious things, were we to say that all that are consist in a desirous tension toward the act-of-vision (θεωρία, theoría, Armstrong: “contemplation”) and look towards this accomplishment, not only the living things that have logos but also those that do not have logos as well as the power of growth (φύσις, physis) in plants and the earth that generates them, and that all of them holding up in agreement with their manifestivity (φύσις, physis, Armstrong: “natural state”) do succeed in getting it, in so far as it is possible for them, and each succeeds and unfolds as act-of-vision (θεωρεῖν, theoreín, Armstrong: “contemplate”) differently, some truly, some others grasping an imitation and an image of it––could, then, one stand such a paradoxical thesis? But since this thesis is something between us, there will be no danger in playing with our own things. So, we too are unfolding an act-of-vision while playing? Indeed, both we and whoever plays do exactly that or better play desirously tending towards that. It might even be that, when either a child or a man plays or does serious stuff, it is because of an act-of-vision that the one plays and the other does serious stuff; and that every activity (πρᾶξις, praxis, Armstrong: “action”) is earnestly towards an act-of-vision, and one activity is marked by necessity and drags the act-of-vision more towards the outside, the other is the so-called voluntary and drags the act-of-vision less so, but also in its case it comes-into-being through a desire towards an act-of-vision. But we’ll talk about this later: for now, let’s talk about the earth itself and trees and in general the plants, what’s their act-of-vision, and in which way we will bring up these things that are made and are generated by the earth to the being-at-work (ἐνέργεια, energeia, Armstrong: “activity”) typical of the act-of-vision, and in which way the power of growth (φύσις, physis, Armstrong: “nature”), which they say has no imagination nor logos, has in itself the act-of-vision and makes what it makes through an act-of-vision, which it does not have.
2. It is certainly clear to anybody that here there is no need of hands or feet or of any tool brought from the outside or innate, but only of matter, upon which the power-of-growth will make, and will shape into an eidos. We must eliminate also wrenching when thinking of the making proper to the power-of-growth. For, what kind of pushing or which wrenching makes colors various and of all kinds as well as shapes? Since neither the wax-modelers nor those who shape figurines, looking at whom they thought that the making of the power-of-growth is of such a kind, can make colors without bringing them upon the things they make from elsewhere. But considering that as there must be something upon those who pursue such crafts which remains stable in them and according to which in so far as it remains stable they will make through their hands their own works, they should have reached up to one such thing proper to the power-of-growth and they should have understood that also here the potency (δύναμις, dynamis, Armstrong: “power”) that does not make through hands must remain stable and remain stable in its wholeness. For there is no need that some of the parts [of the power-of-growth] be stable, while some of them be set in motion––for, matter is what is set in motion, whereas nothing is set in motion by it––otherwise that [the stable thing in the power-of-growth] won’t be the first mover, nor will the power-of-growth be that, but the unmoved that is in the whole. But one could say that the logos is unmoved, whereas the power-of-growth is other from the logos and is set in motion. If however something belonging to the power-of-growth is unmoved, precisely this is the logos. For, the power-of-growth must be itself an eidos and not [something resulting] out of matter and eidos: for, why would it need warm or cold matter? The matter that lies beneath and is worked upon comes bringing this, or rather becomes such once made into a logos, not having quality before. For, there is no need for fire to come forth, in order for matter to become fire, but the logos must come forth: and a not insignificant sign of this is that in the animals and in the plants the logoi are the makers and the power-of-growth is a logos, which makes another logos, something generated by it, which in its turn gives something to what lies beneath, while it itself remains stable. The logos, then, that appears in the visible shape is already the last one and is dead and cannot make another one, whereas the one that has life, which is the brother of the one that makes the shape and which also has the same potency, makes in what [upon what] comes-into-being. 
3.  In which way, then, while making and making as it does can it be connected with an act-of-vision of sorts? Certainly, if it makes by remaining stable and by remaining stable in itself is a logos, it can itself be act-of-vision. For, activity (πρᾶξις, praxis, Armstrong: “action”) can take place according to a logos, clearly being different from logos: certainly the logos which itself is together with the activity and oversights it, cannot be ac activity. If, then, it is not an activity bu a logos, it is an act-of-vision: indeed regarding any logos the very last one comes from an act-of-vision and is an act-of-vision in the sense that it stands as an accomplished-embracing-of-itself as act-of-vision (cf. my commentary ad locum; ιτεθεωρημένος, tetheoreménos, Armstrong: “being contemplated”), the one before the last is different every time, e.g. one is not as power-of-growth but as soul, another one is in the power-of-growth and is the power-of-growth. Hence, also this comes into being from an act-of-vision? Of course it comes from an act-of-vision. Also this, then, is as accomplished-embracing-of-itself through an act-of-vision centered on itself (cf. my commentary ad locum; τεθεωρηκὼς αὑτόν, tetheorekós hautón, Armstrong: “it has itself contemplated itself”)? How otherwise? For, it is the result of an act-of-vision and of something that stands as act-of-vision. In which way does the power-of-growth have the act-of-vision? It does not have the one that results from reasoning (ἐκ λόγου, ek logou): by “from reasoning” I mean the researching into the things that it possesses. Through what then, being it a kind of life, is it also a logos and a making potency? Perhaps because the researching equates to not possessing yet? But the power-of-growth does possess, and through the fact that it possesses, it also makes. Hence, for it being what it is coincides with making, and because it is and in so far as it is, it unfolds as making. It is indeed act-of-vision and object-of-vision, for it is a logos. By unfolding as act-of-vision and object-of-vision and logos, it precisely makes in so far as it unfolds as these realities. Hence, making has showed itself to us to be an act-of-vision: for, it is an act-of-vision, which remains stable as act-of-vision doing nothing else, but it makes precisely by unfolding as act-of-vision.
4. And if one were to ask it what for it makes, assuming that it would pay attention to the one asking and speak, it would say: “You should not have asked, but you as well understand through silence, exactly like I stay silent and am not in the habit of speaking. Understand what? That what comes into being is my vision, a being silent, and coming into being it manifests itself as object-of-vision, and I myself coming from an act-of-vision up there, I manifest myself as loving vision. And my unfolding as act-of-vision makes an object-of-vision, like the geometricians draw by sustained act-of-vision: but I do not draw anything, I just unfold as act-of-vision, and the lines of the bodies come into subsistence as if falling down from me. It is proper to me the affection of my mother and of my parents: for, they too come from an act-of-vision and my coming-into-being happens while they do nothing, but while they stand as greater logoi and keep themselves in an act-of-vision I perpetually come-into-being. What does this mean? That the so-called power-of-growth being a soul, generated by a soul that comes before it and lives in a more powerful manner, possessing quietly in itself an act-of-vision directed neither upwards nor downwards, but staying stably in what it is, in this station of its which is a sort of consciousness, through this comprehension and consciousness it saw what comes after itself, as much as it was possible to it to see, and did not look for other things, having brought to completion an object-of-vision splendid and gracious. And if one were to want to give it some kind of comprehension and a sensation, these would not be the same of the comprehension and sensation of which we speak regarding other things, but as if one were to compare the comprehension and sensation of one who is awake to those of one who is asleep. For, it rests upon keeping in its act-of-vision its own object-of-vision, which has come-into-being for it from the fact that it remains stably in and within the power-of-growth and [this way] is an object-of-vision: and a soundless act-of-vision, but dimmer. For, there is another that is clearer than it in regards to vision, while it [the power-of-growth] is the image of an other act-of-vision. Because of this also what is generated by it is weak in anyway, since a weak act-of-vision makes a weak object-of-vision: since even men, when they are weak in regards to the act-of-vision, make activity that is a shadow of an act-of-vision and of a logos. For, since they do not possess sufficiently what is proper of the act-of-vision because of a weakness of soul, being incapable to grasp sufficiently the object-of-vision and consequently being unfulfilled, but still tending in desire to see it, they are brought to activity, so that they be able to see what they could see with their intellect. When they make, they themselves want to see and they want that also the others grasp in an act-of-vision and feel it, when they lay an activity out as much as it is possible to them. Everywhere we will find out that making and activity are either a weakness or the follow-up of an act-of-vision: it is a weakness if one possesses nothing after what is done, a follow-up if one possesses something better than what is made to keep in the act-of-vision. For, why would one come as a first recourse to the image of what is true, when he can keep in an act-of-vision the true? This shows also in the duller boys, who being incapable in relation to the disciplines and theories are brought down to the crafts and the manual works. 
5.  But having said in which way the coming-into-being is an act-of-vision regarding the power-of-growth, going up to the Soul that comes before the power-of-growth let’s say that its act-of-vision and its loving of understanding and its investigative part and the throes resulting from the things it has known and its being filled make it so that, while the soul itself exists as an object-of-vision through and through, it makes an other object-of-vision: such as craft makes it: when each craft is full, it makes another one, a sort of small craft, in a toy that contains the image of all things; however, these visions and objects-of-vision are sort of dim and they cannot help themselves. Its part characterized by logos is up and being always filled and illuminated remains stably there, then there is that part which participates thanks to that first participation belonging to the other part which already participated: for, it constantly proceeds life from life: with its being-at-work it reaches everywhere and there is no place which it steers away from. Proceeding, then, it lets what comes beforehand, that part of itself which comes first, remain stably there where it left it; leaving behind what comes before itself, it won’t be everywhere anymore, but it will only in in that in which it ends up. What proceeds ahead is not equal to what remains stable. If, then, it must be everywhere and there must be no place in which its being-at-work does not reach, and if what comes first is other from what comes after, and the being-at-work comes either from an act-0f-vision or from an activity, and if there was no activity yet –for, it is not possible that there be any before an act-of-vision–, it is then necessary that one be weaker than the other, but that all and each of them be an act-of-vision: so that what seems to be an activity, when looked at in relation to an act-of-vision, is the weakest act-of-vision: for, what is generated must be of the same genre [of its generator], but certainly it must be weaker, because of its fading away as it comes down. All things come-into-being noiselessly, because they do not need an act-of-vision or an activity that appear outside, whereas the soul that acts-as-vision and what acts-as-vision in this way is in a way outwards oriented and the part of the soul which comes after does not make in quite the same way as the part of it which comes before, but indeed an act-of-vision makes the act-of-vision. For, neither the act-of-vision nor the object-of-vision have a limit. Because of this, indeed because of this it is everywhere: for, where could it not be? Since in every and each soul there is the same. It does not get circumscribed by a magnitude. However, it is not in every and each thing in the same way, so that it is not in the same way in each part of the soul. Hence, the charioteer gives to the horses a portion of what he saw, while they, receiving it, clearly could crave what they saw: for, they did not receive all of it. If then in their craving they act, they act in view of what they crave for. And that was an object-of-vision and an act-of-vision. 
6.  Therefore, activity is in view of an act-of-vision and of an object-of-vision: so that also for those who act the end is the act-of-vision, and in a certain sense what they could not grasp right away, they try to get it by going around. And when they succeed in getting what they wanted, the thing they wanted to come to be, they wanted it not so that they could not know it, but so that they could know and see it present in the soul, clearly because it lies there visible. Since they act in view of a good: and this not in such a way that it stays outside of them, nor in such a way that they do not possess it, but so that they can possess that good that results from their activity. And where do they possess it? In the soul! So, activity has again gone back full circle to the act-of-vision: for, what one grasps in the soul that is a logos, what else can it be but a silent logos? And it possesses it more, the more it is silent. For, it is then that the soul remains tranquil and does not search anything since it’s filled, and the act-of-vision that consists in this being confident of possessing lies inside. And the more that confidence is evident, the more tranquil is the act-of-vision, through which it goes further towards being one, and the knower in so far as it knows –it’s time to talk seriously– comes to one with the object-of-knowledge. For, if they are two, one will be one thing, and the other another: so that in a certain way they are juxtaposed, and this double thing does not yet appropriate, like when the logoi being present inside a soul do not make anything. Because of this the logos must not be outside, but become one with the soul of the one who learns, until it finds it to be its own. The soul, then, once it has familiarized itself with and disposed itself in agreement with it, it still brings it forth and handles it –for it did not have it in a primary way– and learns it up, and through this handling it becomes in a way other from it, and thinking it through it observes it, as if being itself a thing looking at it as another thing: although it itself is a logos and in a way an intellect, but an intellect that looks at another. For, it is not full, but it lacks what comes before itself: nevertheless, also the soul sees tranquilly what it has brought forth. What it did not bring forth at that moment, it does not bring forth anymore, but what it does bring forth, it brings it forth for the benefice of that lacking part, so that through a thorough inspection it can learn up what it possesses. In any practical activity it fits what it has to external things. And because it possesses more than the power-of-growth does, it is also more tranquil, and since it is more full, it is also a more intense act-of-vision, but because it does not tend in perfect desire, it has more of the learning-up of the object-of-vision and of the act-of-vision that results out of inspecting. And leaving its station and getting among other things, then going up again, it acts-as-vision with that part of it which is left up; whereas that soul that remains in itself does less so. Because of this, the wise man is thoroughly turned into a logos and manifests to others what he has: but in relation to himself he is vision. For, this man is already in relation to the one and to the tranquil part not only regards the outer things, but also regards himself, and everything to him lies inside.

export const plotinus_e3_c8_eng_by_para = [`    Starting out by playing before getting into serious things, were we to say that all that are consist in a desirous tension toward the act-of-vision (θεωρία, theoría, Armstrong: “contemplation”) and look towards this accomplishment, not only the living things that have logos but also those that do not have logos as well as the power of growth (φύσις, physis) in plants and the earth that generates them, and that all of them holding up in agreement with their manifestivity (φύσις, physis, Armstrong: “natural state”) do succeed in getting it, in so far as it is possible for them, and each succeeds and unfolds as act-of-vision (θεωρεῖν, theoreín, Armstrong: “contemplate”) differently, some truly, some others grasping an imitation and an image of it––could, then, one stand such a paradoxical thesis? But since this thesis is something between us, there will be no danger in playing with our own things. So, we too are unfolding an act-of-vision while playing? Indeed, both we and whoever plays do exactly that or better play desirously tending towards that. It might even be that, when either a child or a man plays or does serious stuff, it is because of an act-of-vision that the one plays and the other does serious stuff; and that every activity (πρᾶξις, praxis, Armstrong: “action”) is earnestly towards an act-of-vision, and one activity is marked by necessity and drags the act-of-vision more towards the outside, the other is the so-called voluntary and drags the act-of-vision less so, but also in its case it comes-into-being through a desire towards an act-of-vision. But we’ll talk about this later: for now, let’s talk about the earth itself and trees and in general the plants, what’s their act-of-vision, and in which way we will bring up these things that are made and are generated by the earth to the being-at-work (ἐνέργεια, energeia, Armstrong: “activity”) typical of the act-of-vision, and in which way the power of growth (φύσις, physis, Armstrong: “nature”), which they say has no imagination nor logos, has in itself the act-of-vision and makes what it makes through an act-of-vision, which it does not have.`,
    `   It is certainly clear to anybody that here there is no need of hands or feet or of any tool brought from the outside or innate, but only of matter, upon which the power-of-growth will make, and will shape into an eidos. We must eliminate also wrenching when thinking of the making proper to the power-of-growth. For, what kind of pushing or which wrenching makes colors various and of all kinds as well as shapes? Since neither the wax-modelers nor those who shape figurines, looking at whom they thought that the making of the power-of-growth is of such a kind, can make colors without bringing them upon the things they make from elsewhere.

    summary: `Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.`

    text: 'In the reading of ancient texts, such as the Enneads, it is difficult to access multiple translations of the same text simultaneously. Furthermore, many keywords in this major text are difficult to translate and interpret correctly, which prevents one from understanding the text in a complete manner. Our aim is hence to develop an app which can encompass these features, to assist researchers in better understanding ancient texts.\n\nWith the creation of E-nneads Co. we have a goal of developing an app where the original Greek text and its English translation can be accessed conveniently on multiple platforms. We also would like to provide additional materials such as a glossary of key words and summaries to assist with the reading of difficult aspects of the text.\n\nThis allows us to learn and re-learn the works Plotinus in a different way, one more on-the-go and portable - Essentally, “Plotinus in you pocket”.',

    text: 'Plotinus is considered to be founder of Neo-platonism. Being born in Roman Egypt over 500 years and after Aristotles and Platos death, he first and foremost considered himself to simply be a Platonist and a passionate student of his philosophies. \n\nHe mainly set out to intepret Plato’s metaphysical theories (such as the Theory of Ideas) and break them down to clarify the levels behind Plato’s philosophy. He later found himself in a position as a teacher to clarify doubts of those who he thought had misunderstood the teachings and philosophies of Plato. \n\nHe, through the Enneads was also successful in discussing & integrating the different metaphysical ideas of Plato, Aristotle and Stoics during a period late antiquity where the were many social, cultural  and organisational changes happening. One of which was the contemplation of the origin, existence and “goodness” of a “God” or a creator (formation and evolution of Abrahmic Religions). Where through this discourse managed to impact the development of many religions including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc. ',
